Difference between Modules and Packages in Python
It is often that many coders and amateur programmers may confuse between a module and a package. The problem generally arises when it becomes hard to identify when and where a module or a package should be implemented.
In the following tutorial, we will discuss a clear set of differences in modules and packages in the Python programming language that will make it easy for the programmers to work more professionally while dealing with both modules and packages.
Understanding the Modules in Python
A module is a pythonic statement containing different functions. Modules act as a pre-defined library in the script, which is accessible to both the programmers as well as the user.
The python modules also store pre-defined functions from the library when the code is being executed.
Let us consider an example demonstrating the use of a module in Python
Example:

# importing the library and module
import math
from math import pow
# using the pow() function
pow(3, 5)
# printing pow()
print(pow)

Output:
<built-in function pow>    

Explanation:
In the above snippet of code, we have imported the required module and used the pow() function to calculate the powers of the given number as arguments. We have then printed the value of the pow for the user.
Understanding the Packages in Python
A package is considered a collection of tools that allows the programmers to initiate the code. A Python package acts as a user-variable interface for any source code. This feature allows a Python package to work at a defined time for any functional script in the runtime.
Let us consider the following example demonstrating the package in Python.
Example:

# importing the package
import math
# printing a statement
print("We have imported the math package")

Output:
We have imported the math package   

Explanation:
In the above snippet of code, we have imported the math package that consists of various modules and functions for the programmers and printed a statement for the users.
Understanding the differences between Python Modules and Packages

A Package consists of the __init__.py file for each user-oriented script. However, the same does not apply to the modules in runtime for any script specified to the users.
A module is a file that contains a Python script in runtime for the code specified to the users. A package also modifies the user interpreted code in such a manner that it gets easily operated in the runtime.

A python "module" contains a unit namespace, with the variables that are extracted locally along with some parsed functions like:

Constants and Variables
Any old or new value
Class definitions of properties
A module generally corresponds to a single file
A debugging tool in the user interface library.

There are some usually utilized tools that allow the programmers to build a new platform with the help of the modules for better code executions. This installs and distributes packages throughout the library in runtime as well.
It becomes easier for us to employ the user-specific tools with the help of a well-structured and standard layout for the package.
