Fizz-Buzz Program in Python
Fizz-Buzz is the programming task used for explaining the division of numbers in the Fizz, Buzz, and Fizz_Buzz group.
Suppose the user has the number 'n,' and they have to display the string representation of all the numbers from 1 to n. But there are some limitations such as:

Suppose the number is dividable by 3, then it will print "Fizz" in place of the number.
If the number is dividable by 5, it will print "Buzz" in place of the number in the result.
And suppose the given number is dividable by both 3 and 5, it will print "Fizz_Buzz" in place of the number.
And if the number is neither dividable by 3 nor 5, it will print the number as the string.

For solving the above problem and considering the limitations, we have to follow the below steps:
In the program, we have to apply the condition for all the numbers from 1 to 'n.'
Example:

class Example(object):
   def Fizz_Buzz(self, n):
      """
      :type n: int
      :rtype: List[str]
      """
      result = []
      for i in range(1 , n+1):
         if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            result.append(" Fizz_Buzz ")
         elif i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(" Fizz ")
         elif i % 5 == 0:
            result.append(" Buzz ")
         else:
            result.append(str(i))
      return Result
object1 = Example()
print(object1.Fizz_Buzz(55))

Output:
['1', '2', ' Fizz ', '4', ' Buzz ', ' Fizz ', '7', '8', ' Fizz ', ' Buzz ', '11', ' Fizz ', '13', '14', ' Fizz_Buzz ', '16', '17', ' Fizz ', '19', ' Buzz ', ' Fizz ', '22', '23', ' Fizz ', ' Buzz ', '26', ' Fizz ', '28', '29', ' Fizz_Buzz ', '31', '32', ' Fizz ', '34', ' Buzz ', ' Fizz ', '37', '38', ' Fizz ', ' Buzz ']

We can also write the above program by using the loop method.
Example:

for num in range(35):
    # Numbers which are divisible by 15, that means it is divisible by both 3 and 5, 
# it will print "Fizz_Buzz"    # at the place of the number
    if num % 15 == 0:
        print(" Fizz_Buzz ")                                        
        continue
    # Numbers which are dividable by 3, it will print "Fizz"
    # at the place of the number
    elif num % 3 == 0:    
        print(" Fizz")                                        
        continue
    # Numbers which are dividable by 5,
    # it will print "Buzz" at the
    # place of the number
    elif num % 5 == 0:        
        print(" Buzz ")                                    
        continue 
    # in result it will Print numbers
    print(num)

Output:
	Fizz_Buzz 
1
2
 Fizz
4
 Buzz 
 Fizz
7
8
 Fizz
 Buzz 
11
 Fizz
13
14
 Fizz_Buzz 
16
17
 Fizz
19
 Buzz 
 Fizz
22
23
 Fizz
 Buzz 
26
 Fizz
28
29
 Fizz_Buzz 
31
32
 Fizz
34

Summary
In this article, we have discussed how the user can write a python program for the Fizz Buzz problem, we have also discussed some limitations that must be followed.
