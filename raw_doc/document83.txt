Python MongoDB Connectivity
To create connection between Python programming language and MongoDB database, we need to first install pymongo driver. Here, we are creating an example that connects to the database and performs basic database operations. 
This example includes the following steps:
1) Install Driver

$ pip install pymongo


2) Create Python File
// connect.py

from pymongo import MongoClient # import mongo client to connect
import pprint
# Creating instance of mongoclient
client = MongoClient()
# Creating database
db = client.javatpoint
employee = {"id": "101",
"name": "Peter",
"profession": "Software Engineer",
}
# Creating document
employees = db.employees
# Inserting data
employees.insert_one(employee)
# Fetching data
pprint.pprint(employees.find_one())

3) Execute Python Script
This script prints the inserted record on the console. 

4) Enter into Mongo Shell
Now, enter into MongoDB database shell to see the created database and collection.
We can use following command to enter into the database.

$ mongo


5) Check Databases
The following command is used to show available databases.

> show dbs


6) Check Collection
The following command is used to show available collection into the database.

> show collections


7) Access Records
We can see the stored records in particular collection. The following command is used to show the record.

> db.employees.find()
