How to read JSON file in Python
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a popular data format to represent the structured data. It is an effective way to transmit the data between the server and web-applications.
The data representation in JSON is similar to the Python dictionary. The example is given below.
Example -

{  
 "book": [  
  {   
       "id": 01,  
"language": "English",  
"edition": "Second",  
"author": "Derrick Mwiti"   
],  
   {  
  {   
    "id": 02,  
"language": "French",  
"edition": "Third",  
"author": "Vladimir"   
}  
}  

Read JSON file
First, we need to import the json module, and it provides the load() function to read the JSON file.
Suppose, we have a JSON file named student.json, which contains JSON objects.

{"name": "Peter", 
"Subjects": ["English", "Political Science"]
}

Let's understand the following example.

import json

with open(r'C:\Users\DEVANSH SHARMA\student.json') as f:
  data = json.load(f)
print(data)

Output:
{"name": "Peter", "Subjects": ["English", "Political Science"]}

Explanation -
In the above code, we have used the open() function to read the JSON file. The load() function is parsed the JSON file and returned the dictionary named data.
