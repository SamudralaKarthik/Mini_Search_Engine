How to concatenate two strings in Python
Python string is a collection of Unicode characters. Python provides many built-in functions for string manipulation. String concatenation is a process when one string is merged with another string. It can be done in the following ways.

Using + operators
Using join() method
Using % method
Using format() function

Let's understand the following string concatenation methods.
Using + operator
This is an easy way to combine the two strings. The + operator adds the multiple strings together. Strings must be assigned to the different variables because strings are immutable. Let's understand the following example.
Example -

# Python program to show
# string concatenation

# Defining strings
str1 = "Hello "
str2 = "Devansh"

# + Operator is used to strings concatenation
str3 = str1 + str2
print(str3)   # Printing the new combined string

Output:
Hello Devansh

Explanation:
In the above example, the variable str1 stores the string "Hello", and variable str2 stores the "Devansh". We used the + operator to combine these two string variables and stored in str3.
Using join() method
The join() method is used to join the string in which the str separator has joined the sequence elements. Let's understand the following example.
Example -

# Python program to
# string concatenation

str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "JavaTpoint"

# join() method is used to combine the strings
print("".join([str1, str2]))

# join() method is used to combine
# the string with a separator Space(" ")
str3 = " ".join([str1, str2])

print(str3)

Output:
HelloJavaTpoint
Hello JavaTpoint

Explanation:
In the above code, the variable str1 stores the string "Hello" and variable str2 stores the "JavaTpoint". The join() method returns the combined string that is stored in the str1 and str2. The join() method takes only list as an argument.
Using % Operator
The % operator is used for string formatting. It can also be used for string concatenation. Let's understand the following example.
Example -

# Python program to demonstrate
# string concatenation

str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "JavaTpoint"

# % Operator is used here to combine the string
print("% s % s" % (str1, str2))

Output:
Hello JavaTpoint

Explanation -
In the above code, the %s represents the string data-type. We passed both variables's value to the %s that combined the strings and returned the "Hello JavaTpoint".
Using format() function
Python provides the str.format() function, which allows use of multiple substitutions and value formatting. It accepts the positional arguments and concatenates the string through positional formatting. Let's understand the following example.
Example -

# Python program to show 
# string concatenation 

str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "JavaTpoint"

# format function is used here to 
# concatenate the string 
print("{} {}".format(str1, str2)) 

# store the result in another variable 
str3 = "{} {}".format(str1, str2) 

print(str3) 

Output:
Hello JavaTpoint
Hello JavaTpoint

Explanation:
In the above code, the format() function combines both strings and stores into the str3 variable. The curly braces {} are used as the position of the strings.
