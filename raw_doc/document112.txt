How to clear Python shell
Sometimes working with the Python shell, we got haphazard output or wrote unnecessary statements, and we want to clear the screen for some other reason.
The "cls" and "clear" commands are used to clear a terminal (terminal window). If, you are using the shell within IDLE, which won't be affected by such things. Unfortunately, there is no way to clear the screen in IDLE. The best you could do is to scroll the screen down lots of lines.
For example -

print("/n" * 100)

Though you could put this in a function:

def cls():
         print("/n" * 100)

And then call it when needed as cls() function. It will clear the console; all previous command will be vanished and screen start from the beginning.
If you are using a Linux, then -

Import os
# Type
os.system('clear')

If you're using Windows-

Import os
#Type
os.system('CLS')

We can also do it using the Python script. Consider the following example.
Example -

# import os module 
from os import system, name 

# sleep module to display output for some time period 
from time import sleep 

# define the clear function 
def clear(): 

	# for windows 
	if name == 'nt': 
		_ = system('cls') 

	# for mac and linux(here, os.name is 'posix') 
	else: 
		_ = system('clear') 

# print out some text 
print('Hello\n'*10) 

# sleep time 2 seconds after printing output 
sleep(5) 

# now call function we defined above 
clear() 

Note - An underscore variable is used because Python shell always stores its last output in the underscore.
