Python Paramiko Module
Paramiko is a Python (3.4+, 2.7) based execution of the SSHv2 convention, giving both client and server usefulness. It gives the establishment to the undeniable level SSH library Fabric, which we suggest you use for normal client use-cases, for example, running remote shell orders or moving documents.
Direct utilization of Paramiko itself is just expected for clients who need to be progressed/low-level natives or need to run an in-Python sshd.
Paramiko depends on cryptography for crypto usefulness, which utilizes C and Rust augmentations however has numerous precompiled choices accessible.
SSH is characterized in RFC 4254, RFC 4253, RFC 4252 and RFC 4251. The essential working execution of the convention is the OpenSSH project. Paramiko carries out an enormous piece of the SSH include set. However, there are incidental holes.
How to Install Python Paramiko on Windows System?
The significant level of python API begins with making a solid association object. As a client, it's verifying utilizing a confidential key or a client qualification, and the server's host key checking is done. Have more straightforward control and pass an attachment to ship to begin remote access.
Paramiko makes an association with a distant gadget through an SSh connection. Paramiko involves SSH2 as a substitution for SSL to make a safe association between two gadgets. It additionally upholds the server model and SFTP client.
On Windows, To install Paramiko, we use the pip command to run the bellow on cmd.

pip install paramiko

How to SSH in Paramiko and transfer no. of files?
SSH is the strategy normally used to get to a remote machine and run orders, recover records, or transfer documents.
The abbreviation SSH means "Secure Shell." The SSH convention was planned as a safe option in contrast to unstable remote shell conventions. It uses a client-server worldview, in which clients and servers impart employing a solid channel.
SSH is broadly utilized in server farms to give secure administration, remote admittance to assets, programming patches, and updates. The convention likewise empowers safeguarded switch the executives, server equipment upkeep, and virtualization stage organization.
Because of usability, vigour, and various highlights, SSH can be applied in different situations.
These situations include:

Interfacing with a remote host.
Backing up, duplicating, and reflecting documents utilizing SFTP.
Planning a client's port to the server's port to get TCP/IP and other organization conventions.
Sending X Window System from the server to clients.
Burrowing touchy information through a solid channel.
Utilizing a Virtual Private Network.

You can move documents from the remote machine to the neighborhood or the other way around utilizing SCP(Secure Copy Protocol) and SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).
As per paramiko.org, The paramiko python models are a reflection of the SSHv2 conventions with both the server-side and client-side usefulness. By being on clientside, we can verify utilizing a secret word or key, and as a server, you can conclude which clients are permitted access and the channels you permit.
MAKING A CONNECTION
Source code:

import paramiko
ssh_client=paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh_client.connect(hostname='hostname_',username='mokgadddi',password='mypaddssword')
#Raises AuthenticationException, socket error , BadHostKeyException ,SSHException

Output:
missing_host_key raise SSHException('Server %r not found in known_hosts' % hostname) paramiko.ssh_exception.SSHException: Server 'hostname' not found in known_hosts

What are Known Hosts?
You see this blunder since you have not illuminated your machine that the distant server you "trust" the server you are attempting to get to. On the off chance that you go onto your order line or terminal and attempt to interface with a server, interestingly, You will receive a message like this:

The realness of host 'hostname' can't be established.RSA key finger impression is 'vital'. Are you sure that you require to keep associate (no or yes)?

When we select yes here, we let our system in so that it can believe the system, and we can now get to it without the brief until the key for that machine changes.
Paramiko comparably expects that we approve our trust with the system. This approval is dealt with by calling set_missing_host_key_policy() on the SSHClient, passing the strategy we need to be executed while getting to another remote system. As a matter of course, the paramiko.SSHclient sets the strategy to the RejectPolicy. The strategy rejects association without approval, as we saw previously. Paramiko gives us a method for arranging the "Trust all" key strategy, the AutoAddPolicy. Parsing an occasion of the AutoAddPolicy to set_missing_host_key_policy() transforms it to permit any host.
Source code:

import paramiko
ssh_client =paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
ssh_client.connect(hostname='hostname_',username='mokgaddi',password='mypasddsword')

Your user account must now be in the green list zone
Executing Commands on any Remote Machine
To execute the "exec_command" command is called on the SSH Client with the argument passed. The expected type response is in the form of a tuple (stdin, stdout_, stderr)
For example, to list all the files in a directory:

stdin,stdout_,stderr=ssh_client.exec_command("ls")

Getting the type for each of the returned,

type(stdin) and type(stdout_) is 'paramiko.channel.ChannelFile' type(stderr) is class 'paramiko.channel.ChannelStderrFile'

The stdin is a composed just record that can be utilized for orders requiring input
The stdout_ record gives the result of the order
The stderr gives the mistakes returned on executing the order. Will be unfilled on the off chance that there is no mistake for the command above.

>>>print(stdout_.readlines()) → [u'anaconda-ks.cfg\n', u'database_backup\n', u'Desktop\n', u'Documents\n', u'Downloads\n', ...  . u'Public\n', u'Templates\n', u'Videos\n']
>>>print(stderr.readlines) → []

COMMANDS asking INPUT
Sometimes you need to provide a password or extra input to run a command. This is what stdin is used for. Let's run the same command above with sudo.

stdin, stdout_, stderr = ssh.exec_command("sudo ls")
stdin.write('mypassword\n')
print stdout_.readlines()

Should return a list of folders and files as above.
Paramiko FILE TRANSFERS
The method paramiko.SFTPClient handles the File transfers, which we bring from calling the open_sftp() function on an object of Paramiko.SSHClient.
Script to transfer From Remote Machine, here we Download a File

ftp_client=ssh_client.open_sftp()
ftp_client.get('remotefileth','localfilepath')
ftp_client.close()

Script to upload From Remote Machine, here we upload a File

ftp_client=ssh.open_sftp()
ftp_client.put('localfilepath',remotefilepath')
ftp_client.close()

SSH Paramiko Example: Connect Using a Password to Your Server
This part tells you the best way to validate to a distant server with a username and secret word. To start, make another document named first_experiment.py and add the items in the model record. Swap the qualities for YOUR_IP__ADDRESS, YOUR__LIMITED_USER__ACCOUNT, and YOUR__PASSWORD. Guarantee that you update the record with your own Linode's subtleties.
Source code:

import paramiko
command1 = "df"
# Update the next 3 lines with our server data
Host1 = "YOUR_IP__ADDRESS"
Username1 = "YOUR_LIMITED_USER_ACCOUNT"
Password1 = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
Client1 = paramiko.client.SSHClient()
client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
client.connect(host1, username=username1, password=password1)
_stdin, _stdout_,_stderr = client1.exec_command("df")
print(stdout_.read().decode())
client.close()

Output:

Explanation:
The document above gives an undeniable level model that you can use to integrate Paramiko into your Python code. While all that Paramiko jars likewise be finished with shell orders, Paramiko provides you with all the force of Python. Python gives you admittance to organizing information, circling, parsing, and other strong elements that go past what is accessible in shell prearranging. For instance, if you are composing a program to work out framework utilization rates, Python is better at extricating and computing values from your framework's result.
Paramiko Second Example: Using SSH Keys, we Connect to our Server
One of Paramiko's particular assets is the right treatment of SSH add keys. The early-on model above relied upon the utilization of your restricted client record's secret word. It is safer, in any case, to involve SSH keys for server verification. The model document below gives a report that cautions you of any logins by clients excluded from your rundown of anticipated clients. The Python script depends on Paramiko (notice the key_based_connect_() work) to utilize SSHv2 confirmation to associate with any of the servers in the code's server_list list. Paramiko assists you with mechanizing dull framework organization assignments on far-off servers.
Further developed Paramiko programs send the lines of content each in turn. It does this instead of executing the entirety of an order, for example, df or last, simultaneously to the end. Paramiko is a useful expansion to your framework chairman toolchain while attempting to robotize normal undertakings.
Paramiko is a small utility to report on logins to accounts that are successful, other than those recorded in the variable anticipated. Such a report could prompt an examination of how and why those different records were signed.
Source code:

import paramiko
def examine_last(server_, connection):
     command1 = "sudo last"
     expected1 = ["user_1", "reboot", "root", "sys-admin"]
 _stdin, stdout_, _stderr = connection.exec_command("sudo last")
 lines_ = stdout_.read().decode()
 connection.close()
 for line in lines_.split(" \n "):
           #condition if to decide which line to start with
         if line.startswith( "wtm begin" ):
             break
         parts_ = line.split()
         if parts_:
             account_ = parts_[0]
             if not account_ in EXPECTED:
                 print(f"Entry '{line}' is on {server_}.")
def key_based_connect_(server_):
     host_ = "192.0.2.0"
     special_account_ = "user_1"
 pkey_ = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file("./id_rsa")
 client_ = paramiko.SSHClient_()
     policy_ = paramiko.AutoAddPolicy_()
          client_.set_missing_host__key_policy_(policy_)
 client_.connect(host_, username=special_account_, pkey_=pkey_)
 return client_

def main():
     server__list = ["worker1", "worker2", "worker3"]
 for server_ in server__list:
         connections = key_based_connect_(server_)
         examine_last(server_, connections)
main()

Output:
Entry user4 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 pts/0     192.0.2.0  Wed Sept 22 16:13 - 16:28  (02:14)' is on 192.0.2.0.
