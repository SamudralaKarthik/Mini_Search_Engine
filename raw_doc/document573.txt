Part of Speech Tagging using TextBlob
TextBlob module is utilized for creating programs to analyse text. One of the most powerful features that are included in the TextBlob module can be its Part of Speech tagging.
First, we will install TextBlob and run these commands:

!pip3 install textblob
from textblob import download_corpora

It will then run TextBlob in addition to downloading the needed NLTK corpora. The installation process above can take a long time because of the huge number of chunkers, tokenizers, other algorithms, as well as all of the corpora that need to be downloaded.
In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tag (POS tagging, also known as PoS tagging or POST) is also known as Grammatical Tagging or Disambiguation of the word category.

Input: Life is all about believing.
Output: [('Life', 'NN'), ('is', 'VBZ'), 
              ('all', 'DT'), ('about', 'IN'), 
                             ('believing', 'NN')] 

Here's a list of the tags, with their meaning, and some examples: 
CC : it is a coordinating conjunction
CD : it is a cardinal digit
DT : it is the determiner
EX : it is existential there (For example: "there is" … think of it like "there exists")
FW : it is a foreign word
IN : it is a preposition/subordinating conjunction
JJ : this is an adjective for example: 'big'
JJR : this is an adjective, for example: comparative 'bigger'
JJS : this is an adjective, for example: superlative 'biggest'
LS : it is a list marker for example: 1)
2)
MD : it is a modal for example: could, will
NN : it is a noun, for example: singular 'desk'
NNS : it is a noun, for example: plural 'desks'
NNP : it is a proper noun, for example: singular 'Harrison'
NNPS : it is a proper noun, for example: plural 'Americans'
PDT : it is a predeterminer for example: 'all the kids'
POS : it is a possessive ending parent's
PRP : it is a personal pronoun, for example: I, he, she
PRP$ : it is a possessive pronoun, for example: my, his, hers
RB : it is a adverb for example: very, silently,
RBR : it is a adverb, for example: comparative better
RBS : it is a adverb, for example: superlative best
RP : it is a particle give up
TO : to go, for example: 'to' the store.
UH : it is a interjection for example: errrrrrrrm
VB : it is a verb, for example: base form take
VBD : it is a verb, for example: past tense took
VBG : it is a verb, for example: gerund/present participle taking
VBN : it is a verb, for example: past participle taken
VBP : it is a verb, for example: sing. present, non-3d take
VBZ : it is a verb, for example: 3rd person sing. present takes
WDT : it is a wh-determiner for example: which
WP : it is a wh-pronoun, for example: who, what
WP$ : it is a possessive wh-pronoun for example: whose
WRB : it is a wh-adverb for example: where, when
Code:

# First, we will import TextBlob method from textblob library
from textblob import TextBlob as Txb

text1 = ("Jack, Jill and Bill are living in America. " +
	"Jack use to go for running every morning " +
	"but he got fever last night therefore her will not be going for running tomorrow" +
	" this would be his first time of breaking his running streak. " +
	"jill is a school teacher." +
	"he believes in meditation. " +
	"he practice mediating daily for an hour. " +
	"bill is a fun guy, for him laughing is the best medicine.")

# here, we will create a textblob object
blob_object1 = Txb(text1)

# Part-of-speech tags can be accessed through 
# the tags property of blob object.'

# Now, we will print word with pos tag.
print(blob_object1.tags)

Output:
[('Jack', 'NNP'), ('Jill', 'NNP'), ('and', 'CC'), ('Bill', 'NNP'), ('are', 'VBP'), ('living', 'VBG'), ('in', 'IN'), ('America', 'NNP'), ('Jack', 'NNP'), ('use', 'NN'), ('to', 'TO'), ('go', 'VB'), ('for', 'IN'), ('running', 'VBG'), ('every', 'DT'), ('morning', 'NN'), ('but', 'CC'), ('he', 'PRP'), ('got', 'VBD'), ('fever', 'RB'), ('last', 'JJ'), ('night', 'NN'), ('therefore', 'VBD'), ('her', 'PRP$'), ('will', 'MD'), ('not', 'RB'), ('be', 'VB'), ('going', 'VBG'), ('for', 'IN'), ('running', 'VBG'), ('tomorrow', 'NN'), ('this', 'DT'), ('would', 'MD'), ('be', 'VB'), ('his', 'PRP$'), ('first', 'JJ'), ('time', 'NN'), ('of', 'IN'), ('breaking', 'VBG'), ('his', 'PRP$'), ('running', 'VBG'), ('streak', 'NN'), ('jill', 'NN'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT'), ('school', 'NN'), ('teacher.he', 'NN'), ('believes', 'VBZ'), ('in', 'IN'), ('meditation', 'NN'), ('he', 'PRP'), ('practice', 'NN'), ('mediating', 'VBG'), ('daily', 'RB'), ('for', 'IN'), ('an', 'DT'), ('hour', 'NN'), ('bill', 'NN'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT'), ('fun', 'NN'), ('guy', 'NN'), ('for', 'IN'), ('him', 'PRP'), ('laughing', 'VBG'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('the', 'DT'), ('best', 'JJS'), ('medicine', 'NN')]

In essence, the purpose of the POS tagger is to assign the linguistic (mostly grammar-related) details to the sub-sentential unit. They are also known as tokens, and, the majority of times, they correspond to symbols and words (e.g., punctuation).
