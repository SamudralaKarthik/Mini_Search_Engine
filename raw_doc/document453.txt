Python Function to Display Calendar
In this tutorial, we will learn how to display the calendar of any month of any year using Python.
In the code below, we will import the "calendar" module. It has an inbuilt "month()" function, which takes the year and month of which the user wants to display the calendar.
Example:

import calendar

year = int(input ("Please enter the Year: ")) # Here, it will take the year
month = int(input ("Please enter the month: "))    # Here, it will take the month

# Now, we will display the calendar
Print ("The Calendar of: ", calendar.month(year, month))

Output:
Case -1
Please enter the Year:  1919
Please enter the month:  01
The Calendar of:      January 1919
