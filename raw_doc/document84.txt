Connect SQLite with Python
First you have to install Python and SQLite on your syatem.
Install Python
Use the following code:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade python


Press y and installation will be completed within seconds.
Install SQLite
Installation steps
type in the following command:

sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev

After installation check installation, sqlite terminal will give you a prompt and version info ?

sqlite3

Go to desired folder and create database:
sqlite3 database.db
It'll create database.db in the folder you've given the command.
To check if your database is created, use the following command in sqlite3 terminal:

 .databases

Note: To connect SQLite with Python, you do not need to install the connection module separately because its being shipped by default along with Python version 2.5.x onwards.

SQLite with Python
Create a python file "connect.py", having the following code:

#!/usr/bin/python

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('javatpoint.db')

print "Opened database successfully";

Execute the following statement on command prompt:

python connect.py


Now connection is created with the javatpoint database. Now you can create a table. 
Create a table 
Create a table "Employees" within the database "javatpoint".
Create a python file "createtable.py", having the following code:

#!/usr/bin/python

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('javatpoint.db')
print "Opened database successfully";

conn.execute('''CREATE TABLE Employees
       (ID INT PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
       NAME           TEXT    NOT NULL,
       AGE            INT     NOT NULL,
       ADDRESS        CHAR(50),
       SALARY         REAL);''')
print "Table created successfully";

conn.close()

Execute the following statement on command prompt:

python createtable.py


A table "Employees" is created in the "javatpoint" database.
Insert Records 
Insert some records in "Employees" table. 
Create a python file "connection.py", having the following code:

#!/usr/bin/python

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('javatpoint.db')
print "Opened database successfully";

conn.execute("INSERT INTO Employees (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) \
      VALUES (1, 'Ajeet', 27, 'Delhi', 20000.00 )");

conn.execute("INSERT INTO Employees (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) \
      VALUES (2, 'Allen', 22, 'London', 25000.00 )");

conn.execute("INSERT INTO Employees (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) \
      VALUES (3, 'Mark', 29, 'CA', 200000.00 )");

conn.execute("INSERT INTO Employees (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) \
      VALUES (4, 'Kanchan', 22, 'Ghaziabad ', 65000.00 )");

conn.commit()
print "Records inserted successfully";
conn.close()

Execute the following statement on command prompt:

python connection.py


Records are inserted successfully.
Select Records
Now you can fetch and display your records from the table "Employees" by using SELECT statement. 
Create a python file "select.py", having the following code:

#!/usr/bin/python

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('javatpoint.db')

data = conn.execute("select * from Employees");

for row in data:
   print "ID = ", row[0]
   print "NAME = ", row[1]
   print "ADDRESS = ", row[2]
   print "SALARY = ", row[3], "\n"

conn.close();

Execute the following statement on command prompt:

python select.py 


See all the records you have inserted before. 
By same procedures, you can update and delete the table in SQLite database usnig Python.
