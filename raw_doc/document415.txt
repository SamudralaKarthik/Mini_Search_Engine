How to Plot Rays on a Graph using Bokeh in Python
Bokeh is a Python library which is used for data visualization. It creates its plots using HTML and JavaScript languages, and it also targets modern website browsers to provide presentation elegant, concise construction of novel graphics good high-performance interactivity.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to plot rays on a graph. To plot rays on a graph we can use the ray() function of the bokeh.plotting module.
plotting.figure.ray()
Syntax:
The syntax for ray() function is:

ray(parameters)

Parameters:
The parameters of ray() function are:

x: It takes x-coordinate values of the starting points of the rays.
y: It takes y-coordinate values of the starting points of the rays
length: It takes value of ray length as input.
length_units: It takes unit of the length of the rays.

Returns:
The return of ray() function is:
An object of class GlyphRenderer
Example 1:
In this example we will be using the default values for plotting the graph.
Code:

# First, we will import all the required modules
import numpy as nmp 
from bokeh.plotting import figure as fig
from bokeh.plotting import output_file as OF
from bokeh.plotting import show 

# Here, we will create a file for saving the model 
OF("javaTpoint.html") 
        
# Now, we will instantiate the figure object 
graph_1 = fig(title = "Rays on Graph using Bokeh") 
      
# the points to be plotted
x = 0
y = 0

# Here, we will plot the graph 
graph_1.ray(x, y)

# To display the model 
show(graph_1)

Output:

Example 2:
In this example we will be plotting multiple rays with various other parameters.
Code:

# First, we will import all the required modules
import numpy as nmp 
from bokeh.plotting import figure as fig
from bokeh.plotting import output_file as OF
from bokeh.plotting import show 
from bokeh.palettes import magma as MG

  
# Here, we will create a file for saving the model 
OF("javaTpoint.html") 
        
# Now, we will instantiate the figure object 
graph_1 = fig(title = "Rays on Graph using Bokeh") 
  
# Name of the x-axis 
graph_1.xaxis.axis_label = "x-axis of Graph"
       
# Name of the y-axis 
graph_1.yaxis.axis_label = "y-axis of Graph"
      
# The points to be plotted
x = [0] * 254
y = [0] * 254
  
# Now, we will instantiate angles of the rays
angle = nmp.linspace(0.00, 6.28, num = 254).tolist()
  
# color of the rays
color = MG(254)
  
# Here, we will plot the graph 
graph_1.ray(x, y,
          angle = angle,
          color = color)
      
# To display the model
show(graph_1)

Output:

Conclusion
In this tutorial, we discussed how to plot rays on Graph using the bokeh library in Python.
