Python false
Introduction: In this article, we discuss Python's false. For example, 1==1 is true, but 2<1 is false. A Boolean cost is a variable this is both actual or fake. We are built integrated so that the statistics sort of the variable can be Boolean. In a numeric context, it is miles like more than a few that can be either 0 or 1. In electronics, it's far both high and low.
You can consider it like a switch for a light that turns it on or off. It is primarily based a bit on the atomic unit of a computer. A chunk is either 0 (false) or 1 (true). For now, the bit can be considered a synonym for Boolean.
A boolean value can have either the value false or true. In Python, boolean built-in functions are capitalized. That is, True and False. There is no need to explicitly define the data type as boolean. Instead, Python knows the variable is a boolean based on the value you assign.
Boolean type in python: Boolean values can be of only two types. 
Either True or False. The output indicates that the variable is of Boolean data type.
Example: Here, we give an example of a boolean type in python.

x = true
type(x)
y = false
type(y)

Output: When we compile the above program. After compilation, we run this program. Then the result is given below -
<class 'bool'>
<class 'bool'>

Evaluating Variables and Expressions:
You can use the Python function bool() to evaluate values and variables. This method returns a value or converts it to a boolean value. H. True or False using standard authenticity checking techniques.
Syntax of bool() function: The syntax of the bool function is given below -

bool([x])

Example 1: Here, we give an example of a bool function in python. The example is given below -

a = 30
b = 45
print(bool(a==b))
a = None
print(bool(a))
a = ()
print(bool(a))
a = {}
print(bool(a))
a = 2.0
print(bool(a))
a = 'JavaTpoint'
print(bool(a))

Output: When we compile the above program. After compilation, we run this program. Then the result is given below -
False
False
False
False
True
True

You can also evaluate expressions without using the bool() function. In the example below, the res variable will contain the Boolean value False after an equality comparison is made.
Example 2: Here, we give an example of a bool function in python. Now we compare whether 8 is greater than 9 or not. The example is given below -

print (8 > 9)
print (7 in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
print ("Hello" is "Coders")
print (8 == 9)
print (8 == 9 or 9 == 10)
print (8 == 9 and 9 == 10)
print ("Coders" is not "Coders")
print (not (8 == 8))
print (6 not in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

Output: When we compile the above program. After compilation, we run this program. Then the result is given below -
False
False
False
False
False
False
False
False
False

Example 4: Here, we give an example of python false. The example is given below -

x = 70
y = 50
print (x == y)

Output: When we compile the above program. After compilation, we run this program. Then the result is given below -
False

Example 5: Numbers can be used as bool values using Python's built-in bool() method. Here we give an example of python false. The example is given below -

var1 = 5
print(bool(var1))
var2 = 0.56
print(bool(var2))
var3 = 0
print(bool(var3))
var4 = -8.9
print(bool(var4))
var5 = -5
print(bool(var5))

Output: When we compile the above program. After compilation, we run this program. Then the result is given below -
True
True
False
True
True

Example 6: Here, we give an example of python false. The example is given below -

x = 9
y = 5
z = 0
if x > y and y < z:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)
if x and y and z:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")

Output: When we compile the above program. After compilation, we run this program. Then the result is given under -
False
False

So, in this article, we discuss the false value in python. The Python boolean type is one of Python's built-in data types that represents one of two values. True or False. Here we also give some suitable examples which are related to this topic.
