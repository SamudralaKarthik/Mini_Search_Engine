Python Graphviz: DOT Language
Coming up next is an abstract theoretical grammar defining the characterizing the DOT language. Terminals are displayed in striking textual style and nonterminals in italics. Exacting characters are given in single statements. Brackets ( and ) demonstrate gathering when required. Square sections [ and ] encase discretionary things. Vertical bars | separate other options.

graph	:	[ strict ] (graph | digraph) [ ID ] '{' stmt_list '}'
stmt_list	:	[ stmt [ ';' ] stmt_list ]
stmt	:	node_stmt
	|	edge_stmt
	|	attr_stmt
	|	ID '=' ID
	|	subgraph
attr_stmt	:	(graph | node | edge) attr_list
attr_list	:	'[' [ a_list ] ']' [ attr_list ]
a_list	:	ID '=' ID [ (';' | ',') ] [ a_list ]
edge_stmt	:	(node_id | subgraph) edgeRHS [ attr_list ]
edgeRHS	:	edgeop (node_id | subgraph) [ edgeRHS ]
node_stmt	:	node_id [ attr_list ]
node_id	:	ID [ port ]
port	:	':' ID [ ':' compass_pt ]
	|	':' compass_pt
subgraph	:	[ subgraph [ ID ] ] '{' stmt_list '}'
compass_pt	:	(n | ne | e | se | s | sw | w | nw | c | _)

The keywords strict, subgraph, digraph, Graph, edge, and node are case-independent. Likewise, the permitted compass point values are not watchwords so these strings can be utilized elsewhere as standard identifiers, and, alternately, the parser will acknowledge any identifier.
An ID is one of the accompanying:

Any line of alphabetic ([a-zA-Z\200-\377]) characters, highlights ('_') or digits([0-9]), not start with a digit;
a numeral [-]?(.[0-9]? | [0-9]?(.[0-9]*)? );
any twofold cited string ("...") potentially containing got away from statements (\")¹;
a HTML string (<...>).

Clusters and Subgraphs
Subgraphs assume three parts in Graphviz. Initially, a subgraph can be utilized to address diagram structure, demonstrating that specific hubs and edges should be gathered together. This is the standard job for subgraphs and normally determines semantic data about the Graph parts. It can likewise give a helpful shorthand to edges. For instance, the determination. An edge explanation permits a subgraph on the edge administrator's left and right sides. At the point when this happens, an edge is made from each hub on the left to each hub on the right.

  A - > {B C}
is identical to
  A - > B
  A - > C

In the subsequent job, a subgraph can give a setting to set credits. For instance, a subgraph could determine that blue is the default tone for all hubs characterized in it. With regards to chart drawing, a fascinating model is:

subgraph {
  rank = same; A; B; C;
}

This (mysterious) subgraph indicates that the hubs A, B, and C ought to be generally put in a similar position, assuming they were drawn utilizing dab.
The third job for subgraphs straightforwardly includes how specific design motors will spread out the diagram. If the subgraph's name starts with a bunch, Graphviz noticed the subgraph as an extraordinary group subgraph. Whenever upheld, the format motor will do the design, so the hubs having a place with the group are drawn together, with the whole drawing of the bunch held inside a jumping square shape. Note that, for good and terrible, group subgraphs are not a piece of the DOT language but rather exclusively a syntactic show stuck to by sure of the design motors.
Semantic and Lexical Notes
A graph should be indicated as either a digraph or a chart. Semantically, this demonstrates whether there is a characteristic bearing from one of the edge's hubs to the next.
Functionally, the qualification is utilized to characterize different default delivering credits. Lexically, a digraph should determine an edge utilizing the edge administrator - > while an undirected Graph should utilize - -. For instance, edges in a digraph will be drawn, of course, with a sharpened stone highlighting the head hub. For conventional diagrams, edges are drawn with no pointed stones.
A Graph may likewise be depicted as severe. This denies the formation of multi-edges, i.e., one edge with a given tail hub and head hub in the coordinated case can be all things considered. For an undirected Graph, there can be, all things considered, one edge associated with similar two hubs. Ensuing edge articulations utilizing similar two hubs will distinguish the edge from the recently characterized one and apply any credits given in the edge proclamation. For instance, the chart

severe diagram {
  a1 - - > b1
  a1 - - > b1
  b1 - - >a1 [color=blue]
}

It will have a solitary edge interfacing hub an and b, whose tone is blue.
On the off chance that a default quality is characterized utilizing a hub, edge, or diagram proclamation or by a trait task not connected to a hub or edge, any object of the suitable sort characterized a while later will acquire this property estimation. This holds until the default quality is set to another worth, from which the new worth is utilized. Objects characterized before a default property is set will have vacant string esteem connected to the trait once the default quality definition is made.
Note, specifically, that a subgraph gets the quality settings of its parent diagram at the hour of its definition. This can be helpful; for instance, one can dole out a text style to the root chart, and all subgraphs will likewise utilize the text style. For certain traits, notwithstanding, this property is unwanted. On the off chance that one connects a mark to the root diagram, it is presumably not ideal to have the name utilized by all subgraphs. Instead of posting the diagram property at the highest point of the chart and resetting the trait on a case-by-case basis in the subgraphs, one can concede the characteristic definition in the diagram until the fitting subgraphs have been characterized.
Assuming an edge has a place with a bunch, its endpoints have a place with that group. In this manner, where you put an edge can impact a design, as bunches are sometimes spread out recursively.
There are sure limitations on subgraphs and groups. In the first place, the names of a diagram and its subgraphs share the equivalent namespace. Hence, each subgraph should have an extraordinary name. Second, even though hubs can have a place with quite a few subgraphs, it is expected bunches structure a severe order when seen as subsets of hubs and edges.
Character encodings
The DOT language expects the ASCII character set essentially. Cited strings, both normal and HTML-like, may contain non-ASCII characters. Generally speaking, these strings are uninterpreted: they act as extraordinary identifiers or values that went through immaculate. Names, in any case, are intended to be shown, which expects that the product has the option to figure the size of the text and decide the proper glyphs. For this, it has to understand which character encoding is utilized.
Naturally, DOT expects the UTF-8 person encoding. It additionally acknowledges the Latin1 (ISO-8859-1) character set, accepting the info diagram utilizes the charset property to indicate this. There are typically programs for diagrams utilizing other person sets, for example, icons, which will decipher starting with one person set and then onto the next.
One more method for avoiding non-ASCII characters in names is to involve HTML elements for exceptional characters. In this way, to incorporate a lower-case Greek beta into a string, one can utilize the ASCII succession &beta; As a rule, one ought to utilize substances that are permitted in the result character set and for which there is a glyph in the text style. During name assessment, these substances are converted into the fundamental person. This table shows the upheld elements, with their Unicode esteem, a regular glyph, and the HTML substance name.

In cited strings in DOT, the main got away from character is the twofold statement ". That is, in cited strings, the dyad \" is switched over completely to "; any remaining characters are left unaltered. Specifically, \\ remains \\. Format motors might apply extra departure successions.
Previous to 2.30, the language permitted got away newlines to be utilized anyplace beyond HTML strings. The new lex-based scanner makes this hard to execute. Given the apparent absence of handiness of this over-simplification, we have confined this element to twofold cited strings, where it can be useful.
