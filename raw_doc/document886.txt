Script deployment on Linux
Hence, we are done with the python script (blocker.py) which is running fine. This is the time to deploy this script at system startup.
The process to deploy a script to run at startup depends upon the operating system. In this section of the tutorial, we will describe the process for Linux and windows.
Procedure 
To schedule a script to run at startup on Linux, we need to configure the entry in the crontab schedule. 
The crontab can be defined as the list that contains the commands that are to be run on a regular schedule. The crontab stands for cron table which is a set schedule according to which the script is executed on a regular interval.
Follow the following steps.
Step 1: 
Open the crontab with the -e flag. Run the following command on the terminal on Linux.

$ sudo crontab -e 

This will open a crontab file which looks like following. 

Step 2 
Now add the following line to the file and save it. 

@reboot python3 /home/javatpoint/Desktop/Python/website_blocker/blocker.py


Step 3 
Restart the system now. On reboot, our script blocker.py is scheduled to run at system start-up. As of now, we are in working hours. So let's try to open the Facebook on the browser.

As shown in the above image, the website www.facebook.com is refused to connect. Hence, our script is working fine on the system start-up as the website is refused to connect.
