Python Graphviz
What is Graphviz?
Graphviz is open-source chart perception programming. Chart perception is an approach to addressing underlying data as outlines of conceptual diagrams and organizations. It has significant applications in systems administration, bioinformatics, programming, data set and website composition, AI, and visual connection points for other specialized areas.
Highlights
The Graphviz design programs take portrayals of charts in a basic text language and make outlines in valuable configurations, for example, pictures and SVG for site pages; PDF or Postscript for consideration in different reports; or show in an intuitive diagram program. Graphviz has numerous valuable elements for substantial charts, for example, choices for colors, textual styles, even hub designs, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.
Software architecture
Graphviz consists of a graph description language named the DOT language and a set of tools that can generate and/or process DOT files:

dot
An order line device to create layered drawings of coordinated diagrams in an assortment of result designs, for example, (PostScript, PDF, SVG, explained the text, etc.).
neato
valuable for undirected diagrams. "spring model" design limits worldwide energy. Valuable for diagrams up to around 1000 hubs
fdp
helpful for undirected diagrams. "spring model" which limits powers rather than energy
sfdp
a multiscale variant of fdp for the design of enormous undirected diagrams
twopi
for spiral chart designs. Hubs are put on concentric circles depending on their separation from a given root hub
circo
roundabout design. Appropriate for specific outlines of numerous cyclic designs, for example, certain media communications organizations.'
odd
a graphical UI to imagine and alter charts.
lefty
a programmable (in a language motivated by EZ) gadget that showcases DOT diagrams and permits the client to perform activities on them with the mouse. In this manner, Lefty can be utilized as the view in a model-view-regulator GUI application that utilizations charts.
gml2gv - gv2gml
convert to/from GML, another diagram document design.
graphml2g
convert a GraphML record to the DOT design.
gxl2gv - gv2gxl
convert to/from GXL, another diagram record design.

Graphviz Examples
Sketchviz utilizes Graphviz, which deciphers depictions of diagrams written in the DOT language into pictures. You can click any picture to send off an intelligent manager of that chart. The authority documentation is an incredible reference; however an unfortunate device for novices. All things being equal, we've composed this Graphviz instructional exercise that gives a prologue to its most helpful highlights.
The Basics
A chart is an assortment of hubs and edges. You can make edges between hubs with the - - or - > administrator. Naturally, a hub's mark is its name.
Example:
You can have a graph that uses --:

graph {
	  hi -- people;
	}

Example:
Or a digraph, which uses ->:

digraph {
	  hi -> people;
	}

Output:

The show can be altered by determining credits. Credits for the chart, in general, come at the highest point of the diagram statement, while ascribes for hubs and edges come in square sections following they are pronounced.
Example:

digraph {
	  rankdir=LR;
	  
	  hey [ label = "Hey" ];
	  hey -> world [ colour="orange", penwidth=3.0 ];
	}



Graphviz itself upholds any text style, yet for our facilitated diagrams to work, you'll have to adhere to one of these three text styles:

Tinos (this is the default)
Handlee
Sedgwick Ave

Example:

digraph {
	  Tinos [ fontname="Tino" ];
	  Handlee [ fontname="Handlee" ];
	  "Sedgwick Ave" [ fontname="Sedgwickl Ave" ];
	  "*also Sedgwickl*";
	}



You can provide defaults for nodes and edges to avoid repeating yourself:

digraph {
	  node [ shape=square ];
	  edge [ style=dashed ];
	  
	  watch or see -> thinking -> doing;
	}



Advanced Graphs
Congrats, you currently know to the point of making helpful diagrams! These next stunts can prove useful; however, don't feel like you want to learn them promptly.
Records
Hubs with shape=record are dealt with exceptionally. Note that you want to utilize ports, implied by <angle-brackets> to make edges to and from records. These help show tables and item designs.
Example:

digraph {
	  rankdir=LR;
	  node [ shape=record ];
	
	
	  struct1 [
	      label = "aq|bq|<port1>cq";
	  ];
	  
	  struct2 [
	      label = "a|{<port2>b|b}|c";
	  ];
	  
	  struct1:port1 -> struct2:port2 [ label="xyzq" ];

Output:

Clusters (or Subgraphs)
You can group related nodes by putting them in a subgraph whose name begins with cluster_.
Example:

igraph {
	  node [ fontname="Handlee" ];
	  subgraph cluster_Frontend_side {
	    label="*Frontend_side*";
	    React;
	    Bootstrap;
	  }
	      
	  subgraph cluster_Backend_side {
	    label="*Backend_side*";
	    expressjs;
	    "awss-sdk";
	  }
	

	  React -> expressjs;
	  expressjs -> "awss-sdk";
	}

Yuck, that didn't spread out pleasantly! We'll add constraint=false to the edge among expressjs and awss-sdk to tell Graphviz that the edge doesn't suggest that expressjs ought to be positioned higher in priority:

digraph {
	  node [ fontname="Handlee" ];
	  subgraph cluster_Frontend_side {
	    label="*Frontend_side*";
	    React;
	    Bootstrap;
	  }
	      
	  subgraph cluster_Backend_side {
	    label="*Backend_side*";
	    expressjs;
	    "awss-sdk";
	  }
	

	  React -> expressjs;
	  expressjs -> "awss-sdk" [constraint=false];
	}



Example: Clusters can also be nested:

digraph {
	  node [ fontname="Handlee" ];
	  subgraph cluster_website {
	      label="*Website*";
	      
	      subgraph cluster_Frontend_side {
	          label="*Frontend_side*";
	          React;
	          Bootstrap;
	      }
	      
	      subgraph cluster_Backend_side {
	          label="*Backend_side*";
	          expressjs;
	          "awss-sdk";
	      }
	  }
	  
	  subgraph cluster_awss {
	      label="*AWSS*";
	      
	      DynamoDb;
	      S3;
	

	  }
	  
	  React -> expressjs;
	  expressjs -> "awss-sdk" [constraint=false];
	  "awss-sdk" -> S3;
	  "awss-sdk" -> DynamoDb;
	}

Output:

In the event that you'd like your bolt to begin or stop at the group limit, you need to set compound=true and utilize the lhead or ltail ascribes on edge:
Example:

digraph {
	  compound=true;
	  node [ fontname="Handle" ];
	  subgraph cluster_website {
	      label="*Website*";
	      
	      subgraph cluster_Frontend_side {
	          label="*Frontend_side*";
	          React;
	          Bootstrap;
	      }
	      
	      subgraph cluster_Backend_side {
	          label="*Backend_side*";
	          expressjs;
	          "awss-sdk";
	      }
	  }
	  
	  subgraph cluster_awss {
	      label="*AWSS*";
	      DynamoDb;
	      S3;
	  }
	  
	  React -> expressjs;
	  expressjs -> "awss-sdk" [constraint=false];
	  "awss-sdk" -> S3 [lhead=cluster_awss];
	}

Output:
