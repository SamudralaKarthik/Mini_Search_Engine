Complete roadmap to learn Python
Python is one of the most popular and fastest-growing programming languages in the world. Python is a programming language that is utilized for many different things. You can use Python to develop web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, test software, and even for hacking. It's a great programming language for people who are just beginner.
If you're starting, you might not know what to do first. Should I read a book or look for an online tutorial to learn everything I need to know? So, let's discuss everything you need to do to become a Python developer.
But before starting, let's first understand different usage of Python:
Use of the Python language

People from different fields use Python to do a wide range of tasks, such as data analysis, visualization, automation, developing AI and Machine Learning apps, etc.
You can use Python syntax or scripts to perform many repetitive tasks automatically, such as copying required folders and files, renaming as per requirement, and submitting them to a server.
It is used by mathematicians, accountants, data analysts, network engineers, and scientists, too, not just by software engineers.

All of the above points show why Python is the most popular programming language and why you need to learn it.
Now the questions are, "From where to begin with Python?". How much time is required to learn Python language? How to use Python? What should you learn about when you study Python? What are the libraries and frameworks for Python? So, let's find answer for all these questions.
Why Python? (Figure out your final goal)
Before you start working with Python, you should know what you want to accomplish. Ask the question below to start learning Python.

What makes you want to learn Python?
What are you planning to do with this language?
Do you need to robotize some boring or repetitive tasks?
Do you want to make some web apps?

Most people who are just starting to learn a language make the same mistake: they don't have a goal in mind when they start. Remember that learning a language and using it to build something useful in the real world are two different things.
Your goal should not be just to learn a language. Instead, it should be to be able to build things. So first, look into each python topic and decide what you're most interested in.
Here, we are already talked about the different ways Python can be used. So, first, decide what you want to build. Once you get what you want to build, stay with it and work on the next step, which is to find materials.
Tools for Learning
There is a lot of information and videos about Python online, so it is difficult to know how and where to begin learning it, especially since it can be used in many different technologies.
Understand that a single video course or tutorial, or book can't teach the detail you need to know about Python. As a beginner, you may also feel overwhelmed by the number of concepts, but have patience, explore, and stick with it.
Here are some places to start learning Python that you have found, but make sure that whichever place you choose also has your code.

If you already know programming, development, and its basic syntax, you can read the official documentation or
Use Python Tutorial on the JavaTpoint website to learn. Click here.
You can also try online text tutorials, video tutorials, or online/offline courses, but most of them start at the beginning, which is a waste of time. It depends on your skill and how much experience in programming you already have.
If you are just beginning with Python language and do not like reading the original documentation, you can refer to an online course that covers everything.

Time for Learning
Choose a date to finish the course, no matter what resources you use. If you are a beginner and learn for 2-3 hours every day, you can finish the course in 10-11 weeks.
Now, let's move on to the next step and look at the important Python topics you should learn about. Keep in mind that there is a lot to learn, so once you are done with the topics, start learning more about the Python language on your own.
Python's most important topics

1. Learn the fundamentals and syntax
First, make sure that Python is set up on your system. Just go to Python's official website and download the latest version. Once the installation is done, you can write and run Python code with IDE. Now, you will go over some topics to help you get started with learning Python. It will take almost a full week or a half week to cover all the basics, but it all depends on how you learn. These basic topics are included in:

The Python shell and simple math.
Control structures.
Taking input from the user, Strings, and Typecasting.
Python has two ways to make loops: for and while.
Taking care of errors.
Functions, modules & Imports.

2. OOPs concepts, data structures, and Python things
This topic will be hard if you don't have any idea about object-oriented programming. Use some top-rated resources, and with a little practice, you'll be able to understand the ideas. These ideas will be used a lot in making complex applications, so you should know a lot about them. It might take a week or two to learn.

Programming with objects in Python
Lists & List functions
Regular Expressions
List comprehension
list slicing function
Formatting a string
Lambdas
List, Definitions, and Pairs

Once you've mastered the above topics and spent enough time practicing each one, it's time to put them together to make something.
Python has a large number of modules, packages, libraries, and frameworks that can be used for many different tasks. So, instead of developing an application from scratch, use the python language's frameworks and libraries.
If you use relative frameworks and libraries, it becomes easier for you to build the application and understand the development procedure. Choose a framework or library based on the requirement of the Web development, desktop-based applications, or personal choice.
3. Frameworks for web application development
Python has a lot of different frameworks for building web apps. Some of these are Django, Bottle, Flask, Tornado, and Pyramid.

Django

Django is a high-level web framework that most startups and businesses use to build websites. The Django framework uses the MVC pattern with database support. You can use several databases as per understanding and requirement, for example, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle.
If you are a complete beginner, then you will have a hard time learning Django. The beginners don't know Django terms like page authentication, API, URL routing, and models. Take your time, be patient, look at some more resources, and read each line of code until you understand it. You'll figure out everything slowly and gradually. Learning the Django framework and its features may take 2 - 2.5 weeks.

Flask 

Flask is one of the Python microframeworks that is the easiest to learn. Flask is a good choice if you want to make a simple, lightweight web application. It isn't as powerful or as big as Django, but it still has features like support for unit testing and the ability to build REST APIs. Learning Flask will take 1 - 1.5 weeks.
4. Desktop Applications Libraries
Desktop applications are built using Python Libraries like Tkinter, PyQT, Kivy, WxPython, and PyGUI are great for making desktop applications.

Tkinter

Tkinter is an open-source library that lets you use Python to make desktop GUI programs. Tkinter is easy to learn and has a graphical interface. Tkinter will take about a week to learn.

PyQT 

Nokia owns PyQt, which is one of the most powerful GUI libraries with cross-platform features. It uses both the Python programming language and the Qt library. It can be used to make GUIs for desktop applications.

Kivy

Kivy can be used to make desktop apps, and it also works on Android, iOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.
5. For Data Analysis
The libraries such as Pandas, Bokeh, SciPy, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are good for analyzing data. People who want to become data analysts or data scientists will find these libraries useful. It will take about a week to learn Numpy or Pandas.

Numpy 

Numpy is a package for processing arrays. It comes with a fast array object. It is used a lot for scientific computing with Python, and it has features that are important for data analysis.

Pandas

Pandas is another great open-source library for analyzing data. It gives you high-level data structures (like DataFrame) and a huge number of tools for analyzing data. It can also turn complicated tasks simple in just a few commands. Using this library makes it much easier to change data.
6. In Machine Learning
Machine learning uses the following standard libraries of Python for the operations and development process.

TensorFlow

Google's TensorFlow is the most well-known deep learning library. It is a way for computers to describe algorithms that use a lot of Tensor operations.

Scikit-Learn

Python Scikit-Learn is an essential library for machine learning that was made to work with numerical libraries like SciPy and NumPy.

PyTorch

PyTorch can handle computation graphs that change as they are being used. It also has an API that is easy to use.
Make things.
So far, we've gone over almost everything there is to know about Python. The last step is to build projects. If you can't build anything with Python, it doesn't matter how much you know about it. Remember that working on a complicated project that solves a problem is the best way to test your programming skills.
Building a big project is hard for a first-time builder, so start with something small. Start with something easy and then work your way up. If you want to make a complicated project, you should start with a small, simple module and keep adding to it.
Projects are a great way to improve your skills. When you're working on a project, you'll run into frustration, challenges, and other problems. When you try to solve these problems, you learn many useful skills. Getting through these challenges gives you enough practice using Python to solve problems. You are able to maintain your progress along with your project development and learn how programmers solve hard problems in the real world.
You can now use Python to make a lot of different things. You can make simple projects like a simple interest/EMI calculator, a simple weather app, or a simple crawler.
If you are discussing complicated projects, and then you can develop a functional e-commerce site or application. You can refer Web-based crawler that dynamically crawls a specific webpage. Another project option is an Online CV generator that turns raw input text into a PDF CV.
Tips:

Have patience. Learning a first language always takes more time and work, so know that it will take a while for everything to sink in. This is true not only when learning Python but also when learning a new language.
Keep your goal and language in mind. Don't just learn the syntax of one language also then move on to another.
Frustration and pain are important parts of learning, so don't try to avoid them.
You may want to give up because of some hard words, mistakes, and other problems. Don't back out; it's something that every programmer has to deal with. Take some time and learn about the subject using something else and a clear mind.
Be consistent with your learning. If you aren't consistent, learning will take a lot more time and effort.
Putting together a project is always a good way to build confidence, so don't forget how important it is.

Conclusion
The roadmap of Python language learning helps students, fresher, and new learners. It uses to know how to learn python language for professional purposes or creaking web applications. You can know about Python frameworks, libraries, technologies, and other necessary things.
