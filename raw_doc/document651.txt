Automate the Google search using Python
A fully automated search engine, Google Scan employs software known as web crawlers to continuously search the internet for sites to add to our index. In reality, a sizable portion of the pages featured in our results aren't manually added; rather, they are discovered and added automatically when our web crawlers search the internet. The steps of how Search functions within the context of your website are described in this paper. You can address crawling problems, have your pages indexed, and learn how to improve how your site looks in Google Search by having this fundamental information.
Google Search, usually referred to as Google, is a search engine that is made available by Google. It controls 92 percent of the market for search engines worldwide, processing more than 3.5 billion daily searches. Additionally, it receives the most visitors worldwide. Google uses a priority ranking mechanism called "PageRank" to determine the order of search results it returns. Additionally, Google Search offers a wide range of options for specialized interactive experiences, including flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit, and time conversions, word definitions, and more. Symbols can include, exclude, specify, or require certain search behavior.
In contrast to other types of data, such as photographs or information found in databases, the primary function of Google Search is to look for text in publicly available documents provided by web servers. It was first created in 1997 by Scott Hassan, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin. Google announced "Google Voice Search" in June 2011 to allow users to search for spoken words rather than written ones. Google unveiled a Knowledge Graph semantic search function in the United States in May 2012.
Economic, social, and health trends may be shown by analyzing the frequency of search phrases. Google Trends allows for an open inquiry into data regarding search term use frequency, which has been found to correlate with flu epidemics and unemployment rates. It also provides information more quickly than traditional reporting techniques and surveys. Google's search engine started using deep neural networks in the middle of 2016.
Not all pages pass through each level of Google Search's three-stage process:

Crawling: Using automated tools known as crawlers, Google retrieves text, photos, and videos from web pages it finds online.
Indexing: Google scans a page's text, photos, and video files before storing the material in its massive database, the Google index.
Serving search results: When a person conducts a search on Google, Google returns results that are pertinent to their inquiry.

Crawling:
Identifying the web's existing pages is the first step. Google must continually search for new and updated web pages to add to its database of known pages since there is no one repository for all online pages. "URL discovery" is the name of this procedure. Because Google has previously viewed certain pages, they are well-known. When Google follows a link from a well-known website to a new page, more pages are found. For instance, a hub page, such as a category page, may connect to a fresh blog post. When you provide Google a list of pages (a sitemap) to crawl, more pages are found.
Google may visit (or "crawl") a page after learning its URL in order to see what's there. We trawl through billions of online pages using a massive array of computers. The software that does the retrieval is known as Googlebot (also known as a robot, bot, or spider). To choose which websites to crawl, how frequently, and how many pages to fetch from each website, Googlebot uses an algorithmic approach. In order to prevent overloading the site, Google's crawlers are likewise configured to take care not to crawl it too quickly. This approach is based on the website's answers (HTTP 500 failures, for instance, indicate a "slow down") and Search Console settings.
Googlebot does not, however, crawl every website it finds. Some pages may not be crawled by the site owner, while others could need signing in to access, and still, others might be copies of sites that have already been crawled. For instance, despite the fact that both www.example.com and example.com have the same content, many websites may be accessed by any variant of the domain name.
Similar to how your browser renders sites you view, Google renders the page during the crawl and executes any JavaScript it discovers. Rendering is crucial because without it Google would not be able to see material that websites frequently utilize JavaScript to deliver to the page.
Crawling is dependent on Google's crawlers being able to visit the website. Among the frequent problems with Googlebot visiting websites are:

server handling the site has issues.
network problems
txt instructions that restrict Googlebot from accessing the website

Indexing:
Google tries to determine a page's topic once it has been crawled. In this step, referred to as indexing, the textual content as well as important tags and attributes, including title> components and alt attributes, as well as photos, videos, and other types of content, are processed and examined.
Google decides if a page is a duplicate of another internet page or is canonical throughout the indexing process. The page that may appear in search results is known as the canonical. We gather websites with similar information we discovered online into a cluster before choosing the one that best represents the group as the canonical. The alternative versions of the other pages in the group may be used in many settings, including.
Google assesses if a page is canonical or a duplicate of another internet page throughout the indexing process. The page that might appear in search results is the canonical one. To choose the canonical, we first group the websites with comparable content we discovered, and then we choose the one that best exemplifies the group. The other pages in the group are alternative versions that could be shown depending on the situation, such as if a user is looking for a particular page from that cluster on a mobile device.
In the subsequent step, when we serve the page in search results, Google additionally gathers signals about the canonical page and its contents. The language of the page, the nation from whence the material is sourced, the page's usability, and other factors are examples of signals. The Google index, a sizable database maintained on hundreds of computers, may contain the gathered data on the canonical page and its cluster. Not every page that Google processes will be indexed, therefore indexing is not a guarantee. The metadata and content of the page have an impact on indexing as well. Typical indexing problems include the following:

The page's material is of poor quality.
Meta robot instructions forbid indexing
The website's layout can make indexing challenging.

Serving search results:
When a user makes a query, our computers look for matching pages in the index and return the outcomes we think are of the greatest caliber and are most pertinent to the user. Numerous variables, including the user's location, language, and device, are used to assess relevance (desktop or phone). For instance, a user in Paris and a user in Hong Kong might see different results while looking for "bicycle repair businesses."
Even though Search Console may claim that a page is indexed, it won't appear in search results. This might be due to:

Users won't care about the material on the page.
The content's quality is poor.
Robots' meta-directives stop them from serving

The most inclusive type of search, organic search, covers almost everyone. Any company, group, or person with a website who wants their content or brand to be found online should strive to show up in organic search results.
The most inclusive type of search, including almost everyone, is organic search. Aiming to show up in organic search results is a good strategy for any company, group, or person who runs a website and wants their content or brand to be seen online. For-profit companies typically employ advertisements to reach their target market, get more leads, and make sales. The advertising may be used by local, national, and worldwide organizations since they can target people not just based on keywords but also on geography. Google Ad Grants, a program that offers 501(c)(3) organizations donated search Ads for community engagement, enables NGOs to use Google Ads for cause-based initiatives.
Code:
# This is a sample Python program that is returned to automate the process of Google search, with the help of this program the user can easily search the internet with the help of the Google search engine and provide the particular search key for which the user wants to get the data for. we have different functions for the different functionalities of this particular utility
# all the libraries which are required to perform his population are imported at the beginning of this program
from googlesearch import search

import sys

# A class is written which has a different function to perform the different countries which are required to perform a successful Google search, we have different functions inside this class like a constructor function which will be used to initialize the various class object which is required through this program, and then we have function should take the number of results that user want to see for a particular subject so the user can decide the number of searches he wants to see for a particular keyword which he is searching for, and then we have functions to take with the keyword as input for which the actual Google search is going to be performed, and then there is a function to form the actual Google search and the result of that such as stored into a list and that list is it created when the user holds the last function which is the print all the results of the Google search for the keyword he has entered

class GoogleSearcher:

# This is a constructor function that is used to initialize the various variables or we can say the class variables which are getting used throughout the various function written inside this class, in the constructor all of these variables are initialized with a None value and later in the code are initialized with the actual values
