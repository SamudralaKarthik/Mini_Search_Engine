next prev python primepi modul have learn about prime number school day don worri have forgotten about them prime number basic those natur number that onli divis themselv other definit prime number that natur number that greater than don have complet divis factor other than number itself prime number except which onli even prime number prime number except express use form given below abov given express natur number have heard that veri easi deal with number through program languag thi becaus most program languag provid packag which classifi work with number type such integ natur other type use these program languag packag insid program make veri easi deal with number classifi number work with number like other program languag python also provid multipl packag which insid python program deal work with number some these packag come built sourc python some them requir instal when have work with them primepi modul python such python packag about whom have talk abov use primepi modul python program work perform mani oper prime number like find prime factor number etc therefor will learn about primepi modul thi tutori understand function python program work prime well other number introduct primepi modul python primepi python packag modul which provid multipl function that comput multipl oper relat directli indirectli prime number biggest advantag thi modul that use thi modul function prime number perform less time sinc prime number don have factor that sometim becom much difficult work with them such instanc primepi modul becom veri import provid function that carri these oper prime number easili instal primepi modul have alreadi state introduct part some python modul don come built insid with python sourc packag primepi such packag which doesn come built therefor want work with thi modul python have first instal thi modul devic there multipl instal method avail which instal primepi modul machin befor choos these method should find which easiest simplest therefor have instal primepi modul system use instal instal method thi part tutori use instal method instal primepi modul simplest easiest method just have write follow command insid termin shell instal thi modul instal primepi onc write abov given command insid command prompt termin system just have press enter instal primepi modul will begin now have onli wait some time until depend thi modul success instal see primepi modul success instal devic import thi modul python program function thi modul work with prime number implement primepi modul python primepi modul python program perform mani function that includ direct indirect involv prime number after import primepi modul into program function thi modul perform requir task prime number perform follow sever function use function primepi modul check prime number return number prime number return first prime number prime number between number mani other will perform these task use function primepi modul insid exampl program thi section that will understand implement primepi modul implement function check given natur number prime primepi modul determin given number prime not primepi modul provid with check function which check number prime not follow syntax use check function python program prime check num where given natur number program understand implement check function primepi modul use thi function follow exampl program exampl look follow python program where find given number prime import prime librari from primepi modul from primepi import prime take natur number user input num int input enter first natur number num int input enter second natur number check user input number prime check num check num print result output print first natur number which enter user input prime print second number enter user prime output enter first natur number enter second natur number first natur number which enter user input prime fals second number enter user prime true see output print form true fals state whether number enter user prime not that write python program use check function primepi modul check that given number program prime not implement print prime factor given natur number program use function primepi modul easili print prime factor output given natur number program primepi modul provid with factor function that exampl program print prime factor given user input number number given program follow syntax use factor function python program prime factor num where given natur number program understand implement factor function primepi modul print prime factor natur input number use thi function follow exampl program exampl look follow program where found print prime factor given user input number result import prime librari from primepi modul from primepi import prime take natur number user input num int input enter first natur number num int input enter second natur number find prime factor user input number factor num factor num print result prime factor output print all prime factor first number enter user print all prime factor second number enter user output enter first natur number enter second natur number prime factor first number enter user prime factor second number enter user see prime factor both number enter user input print output that know prime factor given number implement print lowest first prime factor number thi implement primepi modul work veri similarli previou implement thi modul onli differ both these implement that will onli print first lowest prime factor number wherea previous were print prime factor given number primepi modul provid with factor which print lowest prime factor given number follow syntax use factor function python program prime factor num where given natur number program understand implement factor function primepi modul print first prime factor number use thi function follow exampl program exampl look follow program where have use factor function print lowest first prime factor given input number import prime librari from primepi modul from primepi import prime take natur number user input num int input enter first natur number num int input enter second natur number find lowest prime factor from user input number factor num factor num print result lowest prime factor output print the lowest prime factor first number enter user print the first prime factor second number enter user output enter first natur number enter second natur number lowest prime factor first number enter user first prime factor second number enter user see lowest first prime factor both input number print output that factor function primepi modul python program print lowest prime factor given natur number implement prime number given natur number suppos have number given have find mani prime number exist which less than equal given number veri hectic time consum task calcul manual that where take advantag primepi modul primepi modul provid option where print prime number given number user thi task primepi modul provid with upto function which with natur number print prime number upto given number follow syntax use factor function python program prime upto num where given natur number program understand implement upto function primepi modul print prime number given number user use thi function follow exampl program exampl look follow program where have use upto function print prime number given number user input import prime librari from primepi modul from primepi import prime take natur number user input num int input enter first natur number num int input enter second natur number find total prime number upto user input number upto num upto num print result prime factor output print follow prime number that either less than equal num given user print follow prime number that either less than equal num given user output enter first natur number enter second natur number follow prime number that either less than equal given user follow prime number that either less than equal given user see prime number which less than equal input number given user print output that upto function print prime number upto given natur number implement print first prime number thi implement primepi modul similar previou implement thi modul becaus both implement print certain prime number accord given number talk particularli about thi implement part will print first where natur number prime number will given number program primepi modul provid with first function which print first prime number output follow syntax use first function python program prime first num where given natur number program understand implement first function primepi modul print first prime factor use thi function follow exampl program exampl look follow program where have use first function print first prime factor given input number user import prime librari from primepi modul from primepi import prime take natur number user input num int input the number first prime number want print find total first prime number accord user input number first num print result first prime number output print these first num prime number number enter user output number first prime number want print these first prime number number enter user see first num user input number program prime number print output that print first num prime number implement get prime number that present between given input number thi implement part primepi modul also veri similar implement thi modul upto function onli differ that here will find prime number between given number wherea previous were find prime number upto given number prime number between given number perform task find prime number present between user input natur number primepi modul provid with between function follow syntax use thi between function find prime number between given number prime between num num import prime librari from primepi modul from primepi import prime take three natur number user input num int input enter first natur number num int input enter second natur number num int input enter third natur number get prime number which between input number between num num between num num print result prime number output print these prime number which present between first second number given you print these prime number which present between second third number given you output enter first natur number enter second natur number enter third natur number these prime number which present between first second number given you these prime number which present between second third number given you see prime number that present between given natur number user print output that between function primepi modul find print prime number between given number next topicandroid develop use python prev next
