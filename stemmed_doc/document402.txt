next prev python listdir method quit possibl that have come across mani instanc life where want know mani what file present directori folder sometim have look file know name don know which folder present that case onli option left look file destin directori now would seem easi mani think just have directori look there thi possibl option thi option will onli work when onli have smaller number file present that directori onli then visit that directori manual look file present there but what case where larg number file let just thousand file present destin directori that case thi option will work becaus take veri long even mani day search specif file present destin directori where thousand file present seem like what should have find file with name within directori have thousand file search name through file explor that also take time previou option time thi becaus file explor will scan through everi file present directori have wait much until complet scan disk done what that have alreadi provid name file present destin directori path then will veri easi check that specifi file present target path also show where need name file present destin directori given list name file present directori text form just have type name that specif file search bar and then will hardli take second find file present list name not thu understand that much import have method where print list name file present directori path python provid with such method where print list name such method listdir function modul learn thi listdir method thi tutori thi python program print list name file present specifi path listdir method python listdir function function provid modul use thi function print list name file present specifi path listdir method also use want print list file present current work directori where program present listdir method whenev requir name file present specifi directori syntax listdir function follow syntax use listdir function from modul listdir pathspecifi paramet abov given syntax have onli given argument insid listdir method listdir function take follow path paramet pathspecifi here pathspecifi variabl repres path target directori from where want know name file thi option argument listdir function don provid specifi path insid function then will print file name from current work directori return type return type listdir function list return list name file present specifi directori listdir method implement understand work implement listdir function will exampl program print list filenam from have divid implement part listdir function into follow part print file name from current work directori print file name from specifi path will exampl program each categori file name each method method print file name from current work directori thi method will print list file name from current work directori use anoth function modul getcwd function look follow exampl program understand implement thi method exampl look follow python program where use listdir method with path argument import modul import getcwd function pathspecifi getcwd use listdir function listoffilenam listdir pathspecifi print name file current work directori print follow list name file present current work directori print listoffilenam output follow list name file present current work directori ipynb checkpoint afef pdf afef jpg jpg png png fruit templat pptx jpg jpg

initi variabl with name pathspecifi store path current work directori thi variabl after that have use listdir function anoth initi variabl listoffilenam store name file thi variabl have provid initi variabl current work path argument listdir function lastli print list name output use print statement don want other function program then also file name from current directori which program present just have leav listdir function instead provid directori path argument after that program when execut will give list name present current directori result output look follow exampl program understand implement thi method exampl look follow python program where use listdir method without argument import modul import use listdir function listoffilenam listdir print name file current work directori print follow list name file present current work directori print listoffilenam output follow list name file present current work directori ipynb checkpoint afef pdf afef jpg jpg png png fruit templat

present current work directori will prefer thi method want list file name from current work directori becaus thi method don have argument defin path variabl thu save extra line code program save time method print file name from specifi path thi method list name file present specifi directori provid specifi path directori insid listdir function path directori from file properti option then same file program look follow exampl program understand implement thi method exampl look follow python program where use listdir method with path argument import modul import defin specifi path pathspecifi user manish download use listdir function listoffilenam listdir pathspecifi print name file directori print follow list name file present specifi directori print listoffilenam output follow list name

lastli use anoth initi variabl listoffilenam insid print statement print result output conclus learn about listdir method modul thi tutori understood import thi function learn about syntax thi function after that learn method thi function last use python program with listdir function understand implement each method next topicpython modul autom prev next
