next prev python queue modul have heard about data structur python they help program develop work simpl word that data structur particular which data organ devic system effect later therefor data structur becom veri import while program develop relat work and want work with data structur must first understand concept data structur they work should also note that data structur present same they differ type therefor work with two three more data structur possibl that they differ type these differ type data structur arrang data differ format help handl differ type data implement these differ type data structur arrang differ data type accord conveni system work arrang data mani form such linear form data structur other most common exampl linear data structur that studi program develop stack queue these most famou linear type data structur that arrang data linear form said that both stack queue linear data structur actual they follow differ approach which data insert remov from them thi approach insert remov data from given data structur make stack queue differ from each other there mani approach program librari packag that deal with these linear data structur mani program languag have differ method work with these data structur arrang data basic approach these data structur same throughout differ method talk specif about python onli which also strongest program languag provid with multipl packag modul which python program work with these type data structur these data structur approach use python built modul base function program handl given data queue modul such python modul which implement stack queue data structur approach program python queue modul help both queue stack data structur approach python program provid mani use function therefor will studi thi queue modul python thi tutori work with learn thi modul function queue stack data structur approach introduct queue modul python python provid queue class function form packag modul name queue modul queue python modul that provid multipl built function that perform queue stack data structur oper python program have access these function queue modul python simpli import queue modul given python program these function queue modul perform multipl oper relat queue stack data structur also store element data structur take them fifo first first out lifo last first out manner these queue data structur function python were origin creat class function mani other object orient program languag such java later these function were also introduc python form modul thi queue class modul creat python that work with queue data structur python use function thi modul therefor becom veri import understand thi modul thi modul function python program work with queue stack data structur will understand implement thi modul creat queue stack data structur object then insert take element from these data structur queue modul python instal latest version python queue modul come built modul which mean thi modul come pre instal with instal python therefor use latest version python don need perform kind instal process instal thi queue modul directli start work with thi modul use latest version python thi tutori therefor will perform instal process thi modul directli start work with function thi modul understand their work onli have follow import statement function queue modul given python program import queue modul import queue therefor directli proceed with implement part thi modul understand implement function thi modul queue modul python implement will understand implement queue modul understand work function thi modul use them exampl program thi part will perform multipl oper use function thi modul will categor them under follow three categori that will becom easi understand implement part thi modul creat fifo queue understand overflow underflow work with stack data structur now will exampl program under each categori understand work function differ function thi modul will perform multipl oper under each categori use differ function queue modul look follow categori wise oper implement queue modul creat queue fifo pattern thi categori will perform follow three type function that associ with creation fifo queue use function queue modul creat queue object want creat fifo queue use queue modul function queue function thi modul follow syntax use queue function thi modul creat fifo queue object exampl program queue queue sizeofqueu see queue modul queue function take onli argument which maximum size queue thi mandatori argument thi function that creat queue object fix size provid argument insid thi function function will creat queue object infinit size put element queue after creat queue object repres queue data structur next oper perform insert element insid queue object queue modul provid with put function which element insid program creat queue object follow syntax use put function queue modul insert element queue object queueobject put element see put function queue modul also take onli argument thi argument element want insert queue object get element from queue will also perform oper get element from queue object thi categori will get function queue modul element from creat queue fifo manner should also note that thi function also remov element from queue along with get element result follow syntax use thi get function queue modul exampl program queueobject get see get function queue modul doesn take mandatori argument return element from queue object fifo pattern understand implement three oper under thi categori mention abov will these function exampl program look follow exampl program understand implement these oper that use function queue modul exampl look follow python program where have creat work with queue object import built queue modul import queue creat queue object with maxsiz argument queueobject queue maxsiz insert five element queue integ data type queueobject put queueobject put queueobject put queueobject put queueobject put get element output print the first element insert queue object creat queueobject get print the second element insert queue object queueobject get print the third element insert queue object queueobject get print the fourth element insert queue object queueobject get print the fifth element insert queue object queueobject get output first element insert queue object creat second element insert queue object third element insert queue object fourth element insert queue object fifth element insert queue object see element from queue object print output order which they insert into queue object that these three function queue modul creat queue object work with python program explan first have import built queue modul python exampl program given abov that access work with function thi modul after that use queue modul creat queue object with name queueobject insert remov element from thi queue object have defin maximum size queue mean thi queue object onli take element after that use put function insert element insid queue object creat lastli element queue object output fifo pattern use get function along with get element from queue object get function also remov element from queue object understand overflow underflow thi implement categori will understand overflow underflow term relat queue data structur python name suggest overflow term refer condit when queue object maximum element still tri insert more element queue term underflow refer condit when queue object empti still tri remov element from both case error will display output therefor have care while get insert element into given queue object apart from these oper will also learn maximum size queue object output understand these oper will function queue modul exampl program look follow exampl program understand implement these oper that use function queue modul exampl look follow python program where check both underflow overflow condit queue object import built queue modul import queue creat queue object with maxsiz argument quobject queue maxsiz insert element queue integ data type quobject put quobject put quobject put quobject put check queue full print given queue object full accord maximum size quobject full insert more element quobject put again check that queue full print given queue object full maximum size quobject full check size queue object qusiz quobject qsize print the maximum size creat queue object qusiz get element from queue object print the first element insert queue object creat quobject get print the second element insert queue object quobject get print the third element insert queue object quobject get check empti queue object print given queue object empti quobject empti get more element from queue print the fourth element insert queue object quobject get print the fifth element insert queue object quobject get again check empti queue object print given queue object empti now quobject empti output given queue object full accord maximum size fals maximum size creat queue object given queue object full maximum size true first element insert queue object creat second element insert queue object third element insert queue object given queue object empti fals fourth element insert queue object fifth element insert queue object given queue object empti now true see have check both underflow overflow condit queue object have creat program that don have face error dure execut thi program that these function queue modul work with queue data structur python program without have error explan after import queue modul program have creat queue object with maximum size after that three element queue object verifi use full function whether queue object full not thi will help prevent overflow condit after that enter more element queue object use put function again check queue object full not then use size function queue modul print maximum size queue object size function will return total number element present queue object after that remov element from queue print them output use get function also check queue object empti not use empti function queue class thi function help check prevent from underflow condit work with stack data structur till now have work with queue data structur that work fifo pattern will work with queue data structur that follow lifo last first out pattern store element lifo pattern queue data structur commonli known stack data structur thing remain same stack data structur have work fifo queue data structur first have creat stack object lifo queue object use lifoqueu function queue modul follow syntax use lifoqueu function queue modul defin stack data structur object queue lifoqueu size data structur object lifoqueu function program with argument insid function thi function work veri similarli queue function which defin queue data structur argument have provid insid thi function maximum size stack data structur object and don defin size data structur object equal then program will defin stack data structur object infinit will work same manner with stack data structur have work with fifo data structur use function queue modul use function thi modul exampl program will perform oper stack data structur object that have perform fifo queue object will also check overflow underflow condit stack object use same function queue modul look follow exampl program understand function with respect stack data structur object exampl look follow python program where have perform queue object oper stack data structur import built queue modul import queue creat stack data structur object with maxsiz argument equal stackobj lifoqueu maxsiz insert element integ data type stack object stackobj put stackobj put stackobj put stackobj put stackobj put check stack object full overflow condit prevent print given queue object full accord maximum size stackobj full insert some more element insid stack object stackobj put stackobj put stackobj put again check that stack object full print given stack object full accord maximum size stackobj full check maximum size stack object after insert element stacksiz stackobj qsize print the maximum size stack object creat program stacksiz get element from stack object lifo manner print the last element insert stack object stackobj get print the last second element insert stack object stackobj get print the sixth element insert stack object stackobj get print the fifth element insert stack object stackobj get check that stack object becom empti print given stack object have becom empti stackobj empti get more element from stack object print the fourth element insert stack object stackobj get print the third element insert stack object stackobj get print the second element insert stack object stackobj get print the first element insert stack object creat stackobj get again check empti stack object print given stack object program empti now stackobj empti output given queue object full accord maximum size fals given stack object full accord maximum size true maximum size stack object creat program last element insert stack object last second element insert stack object sixth element insert stack object fifth element insert stack object given stack object have becom empti fals fourth element insert stack object third element insert stack object second element insert stack object first element insert stack object creat given stack object program empti now true see oper perform queue object success perform stack object which have also perform exampl program given abov have perform these oper use same function that have use exampl that work with queue stack data structur python program use function modul class queue next topicpython yaml parser
