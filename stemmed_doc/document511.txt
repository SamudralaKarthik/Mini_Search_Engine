next prev python chdir method modul python includ chdir function current work directori use util default path command execut directori creation file creation current work directori frequent use command function command line interfac like bash powershel chang current work directori chdir techniqu about modul when work with python there mani moment when like take advantag underli oper system featur thi made possibl python modul which allow commun with underli oper system variou way provid portabl mechan employ oper system depend function python built oper system depend modul design that they util same interfac long same function access modul also provid extens specif given oper system although util them ultim compromis portabl function that take path file name accept both byte string object input output also object same type path file name return when incorrect unavail file name path other paramet that have right type recogn oper system method python modul rais oserror subclass thereof modul allow oper system depend function onli want read write file open path modul want chang path file input modul want read line file command line tempfil modul use creat temporari file directori while shutil modul handl high level file directori oper note these function avail python built oper system depend modul design such that they util same interfac long same capabl avail exampl function stat path provid stat inform about path same manner which happen have origin with posix interfac modul also provid extens specif given oper system howev util them compromis portabl path file name suppli function handl path file name accept both byte string object return object same kind popen fork execv spawn support vxwork code sampl python code show usag chdir method provid librari python import requir librari import import class written that will have member function which will perform variou oper like chang current directori anoth directori which will specifi paramet that function list content particular directori class nirnayosclass init self pass thi function use print current work directori program execut there paramet thi function also doesn return valu will just print current work directori print current work directori self getcwd print the present work directori format cwd thi function use chang current work directori directori which specifi paramet thi function thi function perform oper chang present work directori there paramet thi function that hold path current work directori which want chang return type thi function boolean that mean return true success chang directori current work directori other hand specifi path which want chang invalid there some issu while chang current work directori return type thi function will chang fals chang current work directori self path new dir getcwd return code chdir path new dir print directori chang from format cwd path new dir thi function use list content particular directori thi function perform similar task command linux there paramet thi function which part directori whose content want list directori which pass paramet thi function will consid current work directori program execut file directori insid that particular directori list list file the directori self dir path list dir path list getcwd list content listdir dir path list print the content current directori are file folder name list content print file folder name end print main function use creat object abov written class call variou function that will perform differ oper like print current work directori chang

written abov have creat differ function differ function relat directori thi function like print current work directori code execut chang current work directori work directori code execut last anoth function list content current work directori last menu driven code written which use provid user these three function option execut have execut code root directori after that have chang current work directori code execut level directori which consist three more directori which have confirm opt third option which print content level direct current work directori code execut level direct have opt option chang current work directori level directori then have list content thi directori select option that list content within current work directori perform these step coupl time with code execut select option when code ask whether want continu code execut hold code execut thi articl have seen chdir method provid modul python have also understood variou case scenario user thi function understood actual implement with help sampl code next topicbalanc parenthes python prev next
