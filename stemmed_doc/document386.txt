next prev python pylab modul while perform some task have graph like line chart graph etc mani reason like make task more interact pass inform veri interest way graph easi self explanatori etc that plot graph chart veri import integr part mani function graph chart play veri import role field program develop alway recommend use graph their program therefor becom veri import that should awar plot graph from program matlab consid best plot graph chart possibl everyon matlab plot graph chart have mani interact modul present python that allow plot graph chart output here will talk about modul which provid matlab like namespac import function will talk about pylab modul python thi tutori will learn plot graph chart output use function thi modul program pylab modul python pylab python packag that provid namespac python program which veri similar matlab interfac import function from python numpi matplotlib modul talk about these modul role pylab packag matplotlib modul provid function that help creat visual data wherea numpi modul provid effici numer vector calcul function that base underli fortran binari librari will learn about pylab modul thi section will then plot some basic graph chart use element function which thi modul provid pylab modul introduct pylab modul associ modul with matplotlib modul python get instal alongsid when instal matplotlib modul system also that pylab procedur interfac matplotlib modul object orient plot librari python pylab itself convinc modul becaus bulki import numpi modul function matplotlib pyplot packag singl namespac provid matlab like namespac pylab modul instal have alreadi discuss pylab modul get instal alongsid instal matplotlib packag still want thi modul python program should make sure that matplotlib modul present system matplotlib present system then follow instal command command prompt termin shell instal matplotlib modul pylab modul with instal matplotlib other than thi have also discuss that pylab modul also use mathemat vector oper function from numpi modul therefor have make sure that numpi modul also present system instal then follow command instal numpi modul from command prompt termin instal numpi have instal requisit librari pylab modul pylab modul python program plot graph chart from function pylab modul implement here will function pylab modul plot simpl curv graph use them insid python program understand implement will first start with basic plot curv then will some advanc function make plot graph curv more interact basic plot with pylab modul plot curv use pylab modul python program requir plot command thi command take pair array sequenc have same length let understand thi implement through exampl program exampl look follow python program from which will plot basic curv output import from numpi from numpi import import from pylab from pylab import axi curv linspac axi curv plot curv with axi plot show curv output show output explan have first import function from numpi pylab modul them program plot curv output after that have defin axi curv variabl respect then use plot function provid variabl argument last use show function display curv plot output output that curv display with axi point have defin insid variabl respect advanc plot with pylab modul some argument plot function along with variabl argument provid insid plot more interact curv use pylab modul have provid addit string argument insid plot function print symbol line instead straight line curv understand thi use addit argument follow exampl program exampl look follow python program where will plot curv output have symbol use pylab modul import from numpi from numpi import import from pylab from pylab import axi curv linspac axi curv plot curv with variabl plot show curv output show output explan after import function from both numpi pylab modul program have defin variabl axi curv respect after that have use plot function insid plot function have provid addit argument symbol with variabl show curv with symbol instead simpl straight line output that curv display with axi point have defin insid variabl respect symbol instead straight line follow symbol argument insid plot function want print symbol line instead straight line curv symbol other than thi want also print line with other color than default color plot output curv perform thi task have follow same instruct have color argument addit argument insid plot function that line curv print output will print color choic understand thi use addit argument follow exampl program exampl look follow python program where will plot curv output have color line use pylab modul import from numpi from numpi import import from pylab from pylab import axi curv linspac axi curv plot curv with variabl plot show curv output show output explan have use same logic thi program have use program given previou exampl have use color argument plot function thi program print curv have color line output last use show function display curv with custom variabl output output that curv display with axi point have defin insid variabl respect yellow color line becaus have given addit color argument plot function follow color code addit argument insid plot function want print straight line have choic color curv colour code now wonder whether perform both oper print symbol line instead straight line print with color choic simultan not answer perform both task simultan just have provid both argument togeth singl addit argument like insid plot function then will perform both oper simultan curv have symbol line with color choic will print output understand thi use addit argument follow exampl program exampl look follow python program where will plot curv output use pylab modul import from numpi from numpi import import from pylab from pylab import axi curv linspac axi curv plot curv with variabl plot show curv output show output output have print curv have color symbol line output last also print multipl curv insid overlaid them under singl plot that just have multipl plot function togeth program understand thi method through use multipl plot function follow exampl program exampl look follow python program where have use plot function multipl time overlaid curv import from numpi from numpi import import from pylab from pylab import defin multipl variabl multipl plot function linspac linspac linspac use plot function multipl time plot plot plot show curv output show output output that have plot multipl curv overlaid them use plot function multipl time program conclus have learn about pylab modul thi tutori where learn that pylab modul provid matlab like namespac veri help plot multipurpos curv use python program have plot multipl type curv output import function from pylab numpi modul program after start with basic plot plot curv have symbol line and color line overlaid curv next topicwork with file python prev next
