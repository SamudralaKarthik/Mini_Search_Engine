next prev second largest number python when have element list thought find highest lowest element come mind python made much easier thi articl shall find second largest number python from list sort list then print second last number remov maximum element find maximum element travers list have look first approach sort list then print second last number follow program illustr python exampl program find second largest number list declar list list val sort list list val sort display second last element list print the second largest element list list val output second largest element list time explan part have declar list from which want take second last element after thi use sort method that element list arrang ascend order make neg index sinc second largest number will come second last posit second method obtain second largest element list remov maximum element remov maximum element exampl program find second largest number list declar list list val new list list list set list val remov maximum element list remov max list print second largest element print max list output explan understand what have done abov program have declar list from which want take second last element after thi use method take uniqu element list make max maximum valu from list then remov after thi print maximum result list which will give second largest number third method will loop find second largest number from list exampl declar empti list list val user provid number element list num list int input enter number element list rang num list element int input enter element list val append element sort list list val sort print second largest element print second largest element list val output enter number element list enter element enter element enter element enter element enter element second largest element explan have glanc what have done here have declar empti list which will insert element after thi user provid number element would like list after thi sort method that element list arrang ascend order make neg index sinc second largest number will come second last posit travers list last program will travers list find largest number then make condit statement find second largest number from list follow program illustr same exampl calc largest arr second largest arr largest val arr for rang len arr arr largest val largest val arr for rang len arr arr second largest arr largest val second largest arr return second largest print calc largest output explan understand what have done abov program first step creat function that check largest number from list travers next loop travers list again find highest number thi time exclud previou sinc here object find second largest function final pass list function thi articl chanc think discov some way develop logic find second largest number python next topicdefaultdict python prev next
