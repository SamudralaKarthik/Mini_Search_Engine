next prev python pexpect modul know about desktop oper system their function work some most famou oper system which must have heard window linux maco chromeo among them chromeo also linux base oper system desktop which increas popular linux linux base oper system linux veri popular oper system among programm develop becaus enhanc secur featur same time that much among gener peopl biggest reason behind thi trend complex command use oper work linux oper system base desktop now talk about linux desktop oper system from famili unix like oper system first releas linu torvald septemb other than secur featur other most attract thing about linux that open sourc free licens softwar base foss free open sourc softwar model unlik window mani other desktop oper system linux absolut free download latest version with hundr distribut other featur that linux offer develop faster interpret compil option heavi custom less complex mani other what don have linux still want linux command there could mani reason thi includ want familiar with linux command etc mayb program languag python offer thi option linux command window other oper system thi python pexpect modul which give option autom linux command through python program use function therefor will learn about thi pexpect modul python understand linux command through python program use introduct pexpect modul python pexpect python packag use perform mani function includ autom linux command through python program spawn child process after that automat control them etc pexpect modul veri rich modul python that come with lot function perform mani differ task pexpect modul work span child respond expect pattern defin use python program perform sever function follow some use function that perform use pexpect modul python password ssh telnet autom linux command mani other instal python pexpect modul pexpect built packag python doesn instal along with python instal that thi modul present system alreadi have perform instal thi modul should first make sure that pexpect modul alreadi instal system becaus will abl perform implement without have thi modul present system pexpect modul alreadi instal system instal thi modul through multipl method among possibl instal method instal pexpect modul with instal simplest easiest one that will instal thi section instal thi modul system thi method will follow instal command instal pexpect have write abov given command command prompt termin shell after write command have press enter that instal will start instal thi modul system onc instal process thi modul begin will take while instal modul system success have wait till then see success instal messag display screen which mean that pexpect modul success instal system now move forward with implement part pexpect modul start import into exampl program understand work autom linux command with pexpect modul here thi part will autom linux command through python program import pexpect modul into them have three method pexpect modul which autom linux command through python program follow three method pexpect modul which autom linux command use run method use spawn class method use sendlin method will understand implement three method that list abov use them exampl program will separ exampl program each method autom linux command through note pexpect modul method list abov onli unix base oper system none them avail window therefor these method exampl program will show error output first have virtual environ unix base want these program window oper system method use run method have run function pexpect modul which execut command pexpect run method execut linux command provid argument function then return result execut output run function use replac system method which use execut linux command syntax run method follow syntax use run method pexpect modul execut linux command pexpect run linux command syntax abov have provid linux command argument run method when program run method will execut linux command provid show result output let understand implement run method execut linux command through follow exampl program exampl look follow python program where execut linux command import pexpect modul import pexpect use method with linux command executionresult run echo welcom javatpoint show result output print the result after execut linux command through method print executionresult output result after execut linux command through method welcom javatpoint see linux command success execut result print output explan after import pexpect modul program have use run method with exampl linux command echo welcom javatpoint store initi variabl executionresult lastli print execut result output use print statement method use spawn class method thi method will spawn class that will help autom linux command given program spawn class main interfac which start child process dure execut control through child class string argument give spawn class replac shell command whenev need which must execut program syntax spawn class pexpect spawn linux command see have provid linux command argument spawn class replac shell command which execut when use spawn class method expect function with which also import method spawn class expect method wait child class defin spawn class process that will return given string input when program pattern will specifi spawn class function will match with input string defin child class match string will return output expect use child class will return posit string where input pattern spawn class match output syntax expect function have expect function child class spawn method like syntax given below childclassobject expect inputpattern searchwindows async fals argument syntax expect function given abov thi function take follow three argument inputpattern these input string pattern that would match with pattern have defin spawn class thi mandatori argument given function searchwindows option window size defin size search window default valu thi argument function async thi also option argument expect function input valu taken thi argument true fals default valu thi argument function fals thi valu true when creat non block applic timeout valu use expect function rais return valu will pexpect timeout searchwindow option expect function maxread valu class let understand implement spawn class method with expect function child class through follow exampl program exampl look follow python program where have match input pattern defin spawn class import pexpect modul import pexpect start child process with spawn class childprocess spawn echo javatpoint match defin pattern with input string expect function processresult childprocess expect welcom javatpoint hello return match string index result output print the defin pattern spawn class match index number processresult from input string given expect function output defin pattern spawn class match index number from input string given expect function see index number input string which match with defin pattern print output after execut spawn class that match input string given expect function child process with pattern defin spawn class sinc index number start from that index number print place input string posit explan have use spawn class start child process after import pexpect modul program while start child process have defin pattern javatpoint which will match with given input string after that have use expect function where have defin multipl input string index number string which will match with defin pattern will store result initi variabl lastli print result with initi variabl use print statement method use sendlin method thi method will sendlin function after start child process with spawn class sendlin method will write over string pattern defin child process sendlin method also use return number byte consum pattern string defin will onli thi method match pattern from input string thi part thi method use autom linux command when write string child process syntax sendlin method follow syntax use sendlin method pexpect modul write match pattern child process childprocess sendlin pattern see sendlin function take onli argument which pattern child process understand implement applic sendlin method through follow exampl program exampl look follow python program where have use sendlin function write match pattern child process import pexpect modul import pexpect start child process with spawn class childprocess spawn javatpoint definit pattern child process childprocess sendlin welcom match defin pattern with input string processresult childprocess expect welcom javatpoint hello return match string index result output print the defin pattern child process sendlin method match index number processresult output defin pattern child process sendlin method match index number see index number where input string from expect function match with defin pattern sendlin method print output after execut that defin match pattern child process use sendlin method explan after start child process have use sendlin function where have defin pattern child process then match defin pattern with input string given expect function lastli print index number input string which match with defin pattern child process next topicpython optpars modul prev next
