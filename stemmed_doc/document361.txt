next prev python wxpython modul would have wonder what make applic differ attract veri first place think about applic user interfac right user interfac applic make huge differ number peopl come visit applic interact user interfac allow develop build more attract relat applic that even stand better market also applic with interact make user stay more applic than applic with standard now question will sure come mind what make applic more interact more attract user there import point that make interfac more attract likeabl user follow such point that make applic more attract appeal user first all applic should more dynam have high resolut graphic applic should match theme applic applic should also provid eas featur user have keep point mention abov mind implement them while creat user interfac applic point have mention abov talk about graphic user interfac which make interfac applic more attract such that built with graphic call graphic user interfac veri popular topic nowaday becom essenti part almost everi applic around provid graphic icon audio indic well which make applic more attract appeal user thi tutori will learn about python modul wxpython modul which provid with function creat applic will onli cover introduct part wxpython modul will creat use thi modul insid python program python wxpython modul introduct wxpython modul wxpython modul name suggest modul python that help creat highli function veri interact gui applic wxpython modul open sourc modul which mean freeli avail everyon anyon look contribut sourc code modifi when wxpython modul python implement extens modul thi extens modul wrap compon wxwidget librari which written wxwidget librari wxpython modul work like cross platform toolkit python that allow function creat highli function interact gui pheonix with pheonix version actual next gener upgrad version wxpython modul python thi next gener version wxpython modul mainli focus extens speed maintain applic instal wxpython modul wxpython modul doesn come built insid python therefor have instal first befor start work with instal wxpython modul system will instal from command prompt will follow command command prompt termin devic instal wxpython modul system instal wxpython when press enter after write command instal will start instal process wxpython modul after while will success instal system wxpython success instal devic start work with build gui use function work wxpython modul thi section will creat some basic gui with help function wxpython modul import thi modul into program import wxpython modul python program have follow line code import here will call wxpython modul from system that will abl function program now will some differ exampl where will creat some basic gui like with button with radio button etc look follow exampl program understand work wxpython modul exampl creat simpl have titl welcom javatpoint use wxpython modul import wxpython modul import creat object applic appgui app creat frame applic frmgui frame none titl welcom javatpoint panelgui panel frmgui panel frame applic static text insid frame object applic text statictext panelgui label hello python develop welcom javatpoint show frame object frmgui show start event loop display applic appgui mainloop output explan have firstli import wxpython modul into program function then use app function creat object applic after that have creat frame object panel frame object use frame panel function respect insid frame object creat titl applic object welcom javatpoint after that static text use statictext function insid frame applic that should display while open applic window output insid statictext function use function paramet posit static text display then use show function with frame object creat show final start mainloop function with applic object display thi applic when execut program applic window output when program execut static text titl object exampl creat button applic use wxpython modul program import wxpython modul import creat object applic appgui app creat frame applic frmgui frame none titl welcom javatpoint panelgui panel frmgui panel frame applic creat button applic button panelgui first button button panelgui second button show frame object frmgui show start event loop display applic appgui mainloop output explan after creat frame object applic panel frame object have creat button insid applic built use button function provid wxpython modul use panel object insid button object paramet have also use function here button posit button insid frame applic after that display applic output button creat applic window exampl creat check box applic use wxpython modul program import wxpython modul import creat object applic appgui app creat frame applic frmgui frame none titl welcom javatpoint panelgui panel frmgui panel frame applic creat check box insid frame object applic checkbox panelgui first check box checkbox panelgui second check box show frame object frmgui show start event loop display applic appgui mainloop output explan after creat frame object applic panel frame object creat checkbox insid frame object use checkbox function creat these checkbox gave them name first check box second check box use posit function paramet checkbox function posit checkbox frame applic after that display applic output checkbox creat applic window exampl creat radio button applic use wxpython modul program import wxpython modul import creat object applic appgui app creat frame applic frmgui frame none titl welcom javatpoint panelgui panel frmgui panel frame applic creat radio button insid frame object applic radiobutton panelgui first radio button radiobutton panelgui second radio button radiobutton panelgui third radio button show frame object frmgui show start event loop display applic appgui mainloop output explan after creat frame object applic panel frame object creat multipl radio button insid frame applic use radiobutton function creat these radio button gave them name first radio button second radio button third radio button use posit function paramet radiobutton function posit radio button frame object applic after that display applic output radio button creat applic window next topicrandom uniform python prev next
