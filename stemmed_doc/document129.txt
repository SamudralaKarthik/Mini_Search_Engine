next prev stack python thi tutori will learn basic stack implement use python code what stack stack linear data structur where data arrang object over anoth store data lifo last first out manner data store similar order plate arrang abov anoth kitchen simpl exampl stack undo featur editor undo featur work last event that have done alway pick last plate from stack plate stack element insert element remov onli that end perform oper stack push pop push oper when element pop oper when remov element from stack method stack python provid follow method that commonli use with stack empti return true stack empti time complex size return length stack time complex top thi method return address last element stack time complex push thi method add element stack time complex pop thi method remov topmost element stack time complex implement stack python offer variou way implement stack thi section will discuss implement stack use python modul implement stack python follow way list dequeu lifequeu implement use list python list use stack use append method insert element list where stack use push method list also provid pop method remov last element there shortcom list list becom slow grow list store element next other list grow block memori then python alloc some memori that list becom slow let understand follow exampl initi empti stack stack append function push element stack stack append stack append stack append print stack pop function element from stack lifo order print nelement pope from stack print stack pop print stack pop print stack pop print nmi stack after element pope print stack output element pope from stack stack after element pope traceback most recent call last file user devansh sharma pycharmproject hello stack line modul print stack pop indexerror from empti list explan abov code have defin empti list insert element use append method that similar push method also remov element use pop method pop method return last element list implement use collect dequ collect modul provid dequ class which use creat python stack dequ pronounc deck which mean doubl end queue dequ prefer over list becaus perform append oper faster than list time complex where list take let understand follow exampl exampl from collect import dequ stack dequ append function use push element stack stack append stack append stack append print initi stack print stack pop function use element from stack lifo order print nelement pope from stack print stack pop print stack pop print stack pop print nmi stack after element pope print stack output initi stack dequ element pope from stack stack after element pope dequ explan abov code almost similar previou exampl howev onli differ that have import dequ from collect modul dequ list list store element right next each other use contigu memori thi most effect sever oper like index into list exampl get list fast python know exact posit particular element contigu memori also allow slice work well list list consum extra time append some object than other block contigu memori full will anoth block that take much longer time than normal append function implement use queue modul queue modul lifo queue which same stack gener queue use put method data method take data below method that avail queue empti queue empti return true otherwis return fals maxsiz thi method use maximum number element allow queue get return remov element from queue sometim queue empti wait until element avail full return true queue full queue defin maxsiz default thi case will return true put item add element queue queue full wait until space avail put nowait item add element into queue without delay qsize return size queue let understand follow exampl queue modul exampl implement stack use queue modul from queue import lifoqueu initi stack stack with maxsiz stack lifoqueu maxsiz qsize display number element stack print stack qsize put function use push element stack stack put stack put stack put print stack full stack full print size stack stack qsize element use get function from stack lifo order print nelement pope from stack print stack get print stack get print stack get print nstack empti stack empti output stack full fals size stack element pope from stack stack empti true explan abov have import queue modul that lifoqueu work same stack thi modul includ some addit function mention abov defin stack with maxsiz that mean hold maximum five valu initi array size zero push three element stack use put method now again check whether stack empti size stack have three element stack pop element use get method remov last element first after remov entir element empti stack python stack thread also python stack multi thread program advanc topic frequent use skip thi section interest thread list dequ behav differ use thread program use list multi thread program danger becaus thread safe other hand dequ littl complex becaus append pop method atom which mean they will interrupt other thread build multithread program use dequ caus complex futur question aris build program python stack with thread answer that lifoqueu know that what lifo stand last first out use put get remov stack element which implement stack should consid have mention three method implement stack python abov method have their advantag disadvantag cleat confus use stack with thread should lifoqueu make sure about perform pop push element use thread dequ also list implement stack list have potenti memori realloc issu list dequ same interfac dequ doesn memori alloc issu conclus have defin stack implement brief python stack use real life program choos either implement method accord requir have also defin python stack with thread environ next topicheap sort python prev next
