next prev python multiprocess thi articl will learn achiev multiprocess use python also discuss advanc concept what multiprocess multiprocess abil system more process parallel simpl word multiprocess use more within singl comput system thi method also capabl alloc task between more than process process unit share main memori peripher process program simultan multiprocess applic break into smaller part run independ each process alloc processor oper system python provid built packag call multiprocess which support swap process befor work with multiprocess must awar with process object multiprocess multiprocess essenti perform multipl task within comput system suppos comput without multiprocess singl processor assign variou process that system same time will then have interrupt previou task move anoth keep process simpl chef work alon kitchen sever task cook food such cut clean cook knead dough bake etc therefor multiprocess essenti perform sever task same time without interrupt also make easi track task that concept multiprocess aris multiprocess repres comput with more than central processor multi core processor refer singl comput compon with more independ unit multiprocess assign multipl task each task processor multiprocess python python provid multiprocess modul perform multipl task within singl system offer user friendli intuit work with multiprocess let understand simpl exampl multipl process exampl from multiprocess import process disp print hello welcom python tutori name main process target disp start join output hello welcom python tutori explan abov code have import process class then creat process object within disp function then start process use start method complet process with join method also pass argument declar function use arg keyword let understand follow exampl multiprocess with argument exampl python multiprocess exampl import multiprocess modul import multiprocess cube thi function will print cube given number print the cube format squar thi function will print squar given number print the squar format name main creat process process multiprocess process target squar arg process multiprocess process target cube arg here start process process start here start process process start join method use wait process complet process join use wait process complet process join print both process complet print both process finish output cube squar both process finish explan abov exampl creat function cube function calcul given number cube squar function calcul squar given number next defin process object process class that argument first argument target that repres function execut second argument arg that repres argument pass within function process multiprocess process target squar arg process multiprocess process target cube arg have use start method start process process start process start output wait complet process then process last statement execut after both process finish python multiprocess class python multiprocess modul provid mani class which commonli use build parallel program will discuss main class process queue lock have alreadi discuss process class previou exampl will discuss queue lock class let simpl exampl number cpu current system exampl import multiprocess print the number current work system multiprocess cpu count output the number current woke system abov number cpu vari your number core python multiprocess use queue class know that queue import part data structur python multiprocess precis same data structur queue which base first first out concept queue gener store python object play essenti role share data between process queue pass paramet process target function allow process consum data queue provid put function insert data get function data from queue let understand follow exampl exampl import queue class from multiprocess import queue fruit appl orang guava papaya banana count creat queue object queue queue print push item queue fruit print item count queue put count print npop item from queue count while queue empti print item count queue get count output push item queue item appl item orang item guava item papaya item banana pop item from queue item appl item orang item guava item papaya item banana explan abov code have import queue class initi list name fruit next assign count count variabl will count total number element then creat queue object call queue method thi object will use perform oper queue loop insert element queue use put function increas count with each iter loop python multiprocess lock class multiprocess lock class use acquir lock process that hold other process execut similar code until lock been releas lock class perform mainli task first acquir lock use acquir function second releas lock use releas function python multiprocess exampl suppos have multipl task creat queue first queue will maintain task other will store complet task log next step instanti process complet task discuss previous queue class alreadi synchron don need acquir lock use lock class follow exampl will merg multiprocess class togeth let below exampl exampl from multiprocess import lock process queue current process import time import queue jobtodo task perform complet task while true tri block catch task from queue get nowait function use rais queue empti except queue empti task task perform get nowait except queue empti

function across multipl input valu also use distribut input data across process data parallel consid follow exampl multiprocess pool exampl from multiprocess import pool import time work log data for work print process name wait time second data for work data for work time sleep int data for work print process execut data for work handler pool map work log name main handler output process name wait time second process execut process name wait time second process execut process name wait time second process execut process name wait time second process execut let understand anoth exampl multiprocess pool exampl from multiprocess import pool fun return name main with pool print map fun output proxi object proxi object refer share object which resid differ process thi object also call proxi multipl proxi object might have similar refer proxi object consist variou method which use invok correspond method refer below exampl proxi object exampl from multiprocess import manag manag manag manag list rang print print repr print print output listproxi object typeid list proxi object picklabl pass them between process these object also use level control over synchron commonli use function multiprocess far have discuss basic concept multiprocess use python multiprocess broad topic itself essenti perform variou task within singl system defin essenti function that commonli use
