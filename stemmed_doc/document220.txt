pick your project befor discuss creat requir txt file python know what requir txt need what requir txt file python python requir txt file type file that usual store inform about librari modul packag itself that use while develop particular project also store file packag which that project depend requir run typic thi file requir txt store resid root directori your project here anoth essenti question aris need thi type file project need requir txt help sever way even when revisit project futur solv almost compat issu ever work python project develop project sure know that usual requir sever number packag howev while develop project gener use particular version packag later packag manag maintain make some chang these modif easili break your entir applic therefor much work keep track everi modif packag specif where project big essenti keep track each packag use avoid unexpect surpris standard way solv these type issu virtual environ reason that there main type packag locat where python librari usual store usual need type these packag while work particular project henc requir know which requir project make easier reproduc usual involv follow file system packag that form part standard python librari site packag third parti packag that your instal use pip what virtual environ virtual environ type isol artifici workspac which keep user packag separ from local main system instal allow creat virtual isol environ each python project thi make easier each project independ other project especi where they share same depend there variou packag avialbl that use creat virtual environ some basic packag follow virtualenv pipenv onc virtual environ creat project instal packag librari veri easi requir packag need project with virtual environ let first virtualenv virtualenv type librari that allow creat virtual environ instal virtualenv follow given instruct open cmd type follow command press enter button shown below given imag command instal virtualenv output creat work directori project creat virtual environ insid that project directori avoid unnecessari issu command python venv name env output thi newli creat virtual environ just need activ activ thi isol environ type follow given command press enter button shown below command name envirn script activ output verifi that virtual environ creat prompt that prefix chang with name your virtual environ case have name virtual environ name envirnmnet also verifi open project directori folder where directori with specifi name will creat creat requir txt file order creat requir txt file will good know what contain requir txt file includ type standard packag librari that use that particular project therefor thi requir txt file play essenti role while develop small bigger project also help make project more portabl with help requir txt file sever major problem easili avoid understand more detail consid follow given exampl exampl suppos have creat project such applic that compat with specif version librari packag thu some reason forward thi applic your friend sinc have use requir txt file possibl that your applic will properli even start your friend system main reason behind thi that user same version librari packag howev use requir txt file anyon your project applic becaus requir use packag librari also specifi form file requir txt with your project thi requir txt file user easili select store maintain requir file their requir requir txt file use virtualenv here abl requir txt file creat requir txt file follow command command pip freez requir txt output requir txt file use pipenv pipenv also excel virtual environ creation librari tool that some cool featur follow given instruct requir txt file type follow command instal pipenv command instal pipenv output type follow command press enter button command pipenv instal mypackag abov command use instal packag that requir project output after instal packag project need activ virtual environ therefor activ virtual environ follow command command pipenv shell pipenv these command use activ newli creat virtual environ shown below output type follow command script virtual environ command pipenv python myscript explan thi command use specifi script virtual environ shown below output easier also automat keep track librari use project pipfil pipfil lock file these file play same role just requir txt also store addit inform sever thing that includ requir txt thu thi pipfil altern requir txt file howev still want requir txt file follow command pipenv lock requir txt output requir txt file without virtualenv use pipreq pipreq most effici straightforward tool use which doesn requir creat virtual environ therefor quit use user onli requir packag librari use applic project most import thing that automat scan script python file their import librari gener requir txt let work first all have instal pipreq download type follow given command enter button command instal pipreq output onc instal get complet then start pipreq requir txt file point locat where your project folder locat command pipreq path project output verifi that requir txt file success creat your project folder that file requir txt will creat shown below
