next prev python audio modul python program languag lead nowaday becaus user friendli featur python also mani interest modul librari which user use them most interest featur python languag audio modul thi articl will discuss variou type audio modul their uniqu featur advantag thi articl will cover differ type audio modul librari python pyaudio dejavu mingu hyperson pydub simpleaudio winsound python sounddevic playsound let understand abov audio modul one modul python written program languag creation digit signal process script thi modul python contain class process wide varieti audio signal type thi user abl import signal process chain directli python script project manipul audio signal real time use interpret tool modul python have primit such mathemat oper basic signal process like delay synthesi gener filter much more also complex algorithm develop sound granul mani other artist audio oper exampl play sound file from pyo import sound server boot sound start sound file sfplayer path

input output wide rang function which audio relat mainli focus segment featur extract classif visual issu use pyaudio librari user classifi unknown sound perform supervis unsupervis segment extract audio featur represent detect audio event filter silenc period from long record appli dimension reduct visual audio data content similar much more thi librari provid bind portaudio user thi librari play record audio differ platform like window linux play audio use pyaudio librari user write stream exampl import pyaudio import wave filenam exampl wav chunk size sampl data frame chunksiz open sound file name wavefil wavefil wave open filenam creat interfac portaudio portaudio pyaudio pyaudio open stream object write file play audio use pyaudio thi code output true mean that audio will play rather than record streamobject portaudio open format portaudio get format from width wavefil getsampwidth channel wavefil getnchannel rate wavefil getframer output true read data chunksiz data audio wavefil readfram chunksiz play audio write audio data streamobject while data streamobject write data audio data audio wavefil readfram chunksiz close termin streamobject streamobject close portaudio termin here user notic that play audio use pyaudio librari complex compar other audio play librari that thi librari might first choic user play audio their project applic although pyaudio librari provid more level control which make possibl user paramet their input output devic thi librari also let user check load their input output activ pyaudio librari also allow user play record audio callback mode where state callback function call when data need playback avail record these featur pyaudio librari which make differ from other audio librari modul thi librari specif use user want play audio beyond simpl playback dejavu dejavu audio fingerprint modul python open sourc modul thi modul rememb record audio listen onc thi modul store audio databas after thi when song play microphon input disk file dejavu tri match audio with fingerprint store databas return song record which play earlier dejavu modul surpass recognit particular signal with realist amount nois there form which user dejavu recogn audio user recogn audio read process audio file disk user comput microphon exampl user should creat mysql databas where dejavu store fingerprint audio user local setup mysql root enter password mysql here user should creat databas dejavu user start fingerprint their audio collect from dejavu import dejavu config databas host user root password password import local setup databas name databas user creat local setup dejv dejavu config mingu mingu packag python use mani programm musician research compos make examin music song thi packag cross platform veri advanc music

byte count thi also includ object soundcard filter memori oper file oscil thi framework oper linux osx oper system pydub pydub python librari use manipul audio effect thi librari veri simpl easi high level interfac which base ffmpeg inclin jqueri thi librari use tag audio slice concaten audio track pydub librari support version python howev user open save file use pydub librari without depend user requir instal audio playback packag they want play audio follow code use play file with pydub exampl from pydub import audioseg from pydub playback import play sound audio audioseg from wav exampl wav play sound audio user want play other audio file format like file they should instal libav ffmpeg after instal ffmpeg user need make small chang code play file exampl from pydub import audioseg from pydub playback import play sound audio audioseg from exampl play sound audio use audioseg from file file name file type statement user play format support ffmpeg audio file exampl user play wma file sound audioseg from file exampl wma wma pydub librari also allow user save audio differ file format user also calcul length audio file user cross fade audio use thi librari simpleaudio simpleaudio python librari which cross platform thi librari also use play back file without depend simpleaudio librari wait file finish play audio format befor termin script exampl import simpleaudio simpl audio filenam exampl wav wave object simpl audio waveobject from wave file filenam play object wave object play play object wait done wait until audio finish play format file categor bit store which repres audio data header along with metadata resourc interchang file format also store definit record industri store everi audio sampl which particular data point relat pressur sampl second valu record reduc size file suffici store record like human speech lower sampl rate like sampl second howev higher sound frequenc can not repres much accur some librari modul discuss thi articl play record byte object some them numpi array record audio data both resembl categor data point that play back definit sampl rate play audio numpi array everi element contain valu equival individu sampl byte object each sampl store valu import differ between these data type that numpi array mutabl byte object immut which make latter more suitabl gener audio process more complex signal user play numpi array byte object simpleaudio librari use simpleaudio play buffer statement but befor thi user should make sure that they have alreadi instal numpi simpleaudio librari exampl gener numpi array correspond tone import numpi numpi import simpleaudio simpl audio frequenc user play note will fsampl sampl second will play second note durat second gener array with second sampl rate step rang between second numpi linspac second second fsampl fals gener sine wave note numpi sin frequenc numpi user should ensur that highest valu bit rang audio note numpi max numpi note now convert bit data audio astyp numpi int start playback play object simpl audio play buffer fsampl user wait playback finish befor exit play object wait done winsound winsound modul python which use access basic sound play machineri window oper system winsound modul file play just line code exampl import winsound filenam exampl wav winsound playsound filenam winsound snd filenam winsound modul doe support file format except file allow user beep their speaker use winsound beep frequenc durat statement exampl user beep tone millisecond import winsound winsound beep beep millisecond python sounddevic python sounddevic python modul cross platform audio play back thi modul provid bind portaudio librari some suitabl function play record numpi array which contain audio signal user want play file they should instal numpi soundfil open audio file format file numpi array exampl import sounddevic sound devic import soundfil sound file filenam exampl wav now extract data sampl rate from file data set fsampl sound file read filenam dtype float sound devic play data set fsampl wait until file done play statu sound devic wait statement sound file read use extract audio data also sampl rate file which store resourc interchang file format header sound devic wait statement use make sure that script onli termin after audio finish play playsound playsound python modul which user play sound singl line code cross platform modul which singl function without depend play sound audio exampl from playsound import playsound playsound exampl wav playsound modul use file format file file also work with other file format conclus thi articl have discuss variou type python librari modul which use play record differ type audio file sound here have explain differ featur import each librari modul play sound project develop modifi applic
