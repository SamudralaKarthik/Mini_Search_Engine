known mean tell whether they differ from each other not test also known student test also tell signific differ are other term provid knowledg whether those differ could have occur chanc now understand some exampl suppos have fever naturalist medic fever last some day next time have fever medic store over the counter pharmaceut thi time fever last week when survey friend found that their fever last shorter time averag day when they took homeopath medic thi survey what need know these outcom repeat test will know mean group compar also probabl those outcom occur chanc also student test real life order compar mean instanc drug compani want test cancer drug order check improv life expect experi there gener control group group that provid with sugar pill placebo control group display mean life expect more than five year wherea group consum drug might have life expect more than year result that drug might work howev there chanc could becaus fluke thu test thi research will util student test order find whether outcom repeat whole popul not now understand what score understand score ratio between differ between group differ within group known score score more signific thi mean that there more differ present between group same time smaller score signifi similar between group score three indic that group three time differ from each other within each other when bigger valu while run test more list that outcom repeat thu conclud that follow larg score impli that group differ from each other small score impli that group similar now understand valu valu understand valu valu everi valu
