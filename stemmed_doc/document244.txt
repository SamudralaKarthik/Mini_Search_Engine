next prev python data analyt data analysi help obtain use inform from data provid solut queri further base observ pattern predict outcom differ busi polici understand basic data analyt data kind data which work dure analysi mostli comma separ valu format usual first file repres header packag avail there divers librari avail python packag that facilit easi implement without write long code exampl some packag are scientif comput librari such numpi panda scipi visual librari such matplotlib seaborn algorithm librari such scikit learn statsmodel import export dataset essenti thing that must take care while import dataset are format refer file encod exampl promin format csv xlsx json etc path file path file refer locat file where store avail either drive some onlin sourc done follow way exampl import panda path read csv path dataset doesn contain header specifi follow way read csv path header none look first five last five row dataset make head tail respect let have look export data have file present csv format then path excel path data wrangl data wrangl process convert data from format which use analysi what thi part encompass deal with miss valu miss valu some entri left blank becaus unavail inform usual repres with nan discuss deal with them best option replac numer variabl with their averag categor variabl with mode sometim situat might occur when have drop miss valu done use dropna want drop row have specifi axi want drop column have specifi axi moreov want these chang directli occur dataset will specifi more paramet inplac true let valu replac syntax replac miss valu valu here will make variabl store mean attribut whose valu want replac mean attribut name mean attribut name replac nan mean proceed with data format refer process bring data comprehens format exampl chang variabl name make understand normal data featur present dataset have valu that result bias predict therefor must bring them rang where they compar same follow techniqu attribut simpl featur scale xold xmax min max approach xold xmin xmax xmin score xold averag valu standard deviat convert categor variabl into numer variabl under thi proceed with process call one hot encod let there attribut that hold categor valu will make dummi variabl from possibl assign them base their occurr attribut convert categor variabl dummi variabl will panda get dummi attribut name thi will gener expect result bin python refer process convert numer variabl into categor variabl let have taken attribut price from dataset divid data into three categori base rang then denot them with name such low price mid price high price obtain rang use linspac method bin linspac min attribut name max attribut name cat name low price mid price high price bin name cut attribut name bin label cat name
