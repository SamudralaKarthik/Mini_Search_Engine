next prev python mayavi modul have heard about graphic user interfac known gui must have seen impact chang interfac mani applic basic graphic user interfac type user interfac applic softwar which instead text base user interfac type command label allow user interact with comput smartphon etc through audio indic graphic icon such notat etc display object data such manner that inform tri display convey veri easili through interact user interfac provid whenev user interact with applic object display electron devic chang color text sometim shape too thu make user interact with electron devic applic becom more interact interest user import becom today world find almost everi applic daili live therefor becom even more import that should have idea build work with most program languag provid option creat interact gui with help their built librari extens connect with them python most popular choic among these program languag creat becaus provid with multipl librari through which easili creat gui python have mani built modul some instal modul that creat interact use function these modul program such python modul mayavi modul about which learn thi tutori will learn about mayavi tutori instal featur mani more about thi tutori mayavi modul python mayavi python modul use visual scientif data use visual data other than thi mayavi modul also provid option develop with help tkinter librari mayavi modul which current free distribut under licens develop prabhu ramchandran pronounc singl name vee which stand magic english mayavi cross platform python modul run almost everi platform like unix window run almost everi platform oper system where both python avail latest version mayavi modul mayavi veri much differ from origin becaus latest version compon enthought suit which suit scientif python program other reason that make latest version mayavi modul from origin version that provid reusabl compon plot through python program doe just focu interact program the featur which lack previou version although latest version mayavi modul slightli differ interfac than previou version mani featur which were miss previou version mayavi modul python vision mayavi modul when develop develop with vision provid interact visual scientif other data thi wasn onli purpos develop mayavi modul there were some other vision behind develop mayavi modul look these vision which were behind develop mayavi modul thi section follow vision build python mayavi modul need reusabl tool that emb applic multipl plot data mayavi also seek provid interact easi visual scientif other data multipl applic har power librari without forc learn about mayavi also develop provid rich user interfac mostli focus gui with dialog interact with object data through visual them mayavi combin with envisag applic build framework that assembl access domain specif tool singl place other than thi need clean simpl script interfac python that includ object orient program mlab one liner interfac lead develop mayavi modul these major reason vision behind develop mayavi modul mayavi modul python gener characterist featur have seen introduct part mayavi modul thi modul provid with multipl function visual scientif data veri easili thi onli characterist mayavi modul which make stand scientif data visual modul also some other characterist that make thi modul veri popular short time will discuss these characterist featur thi modul thi section follow gener characterist highlight featur mayavi modul mayavi modul veri conveni option scientif plot data visual through mlab also avail through mayavi extens mayavi modul veri help read sever file format such plot xml legaci mani more mayavi modul cross platform python modul easili these modul multipl oper system scriptabl mayavi modul veri easi use python mayavi modul save render visual data multipl imag format user conveni script mayavi modul from python interpret import python modul program provid work pipelin browser with which object that present pipelin brows edit extend mayavi modul veri simpl easi which mean extend mayavi modul through variou custom sourc file format data filter modul with mayavi modul visual tensor vector scalar data possibl veri easi with mayavi modul import simpl studio vrml scene these some gener characterist highlight featur mayavi modul when through thi list will find thi mayavi modul becam popular short time other than list featur abov mayavi modul also visual engin applic data with latest releas mayavi mayavi modul python function mayavi librari use perform multipl function such visual scientif data develop graphic user interfac develop figur etc import thi modul python program perform these function with help mayavi modul use mayavi some other modul togeth program thi tutori will onli learn about build graphic user interfac use mayavi modul will mayavi modul with some other modul which will discuss later build through python program mayavi modul python instal mayavi built modul python that come pre instal with python extens therefor have instal thi modul system want import thi modul python program instal mayavi modul veri simpl done through multipl method which includ through conda method through jupyt notebook method through method mani more thi tutori will onli instal method perform instal mayavi modul instal thi modul use follow command termin shell instal mayavi have open command prompt termin system write command given abov after write command press enter start instal process mayavi modul when press enter key instal process mayavi modul will start will take while instal mayavi modul system success becaus mayavi modul come with multipl extens librari function which will download instal with system will also build wheel see mayavi modul success instal system start work with thi modul import into python program note have build with mayavi modul thi tutori will also need numpi scipi modul perform thi implement should make sure that both scipi numpi modul alreadi instal system befor move further with implement part mayavi modul scipi numpi modul present system follow instal command command prompt termin instal them system instal scipi modul instal scipi thi modul alreadi present system that shown here that requir alreadi fulfil thi modul present system thi command will instal instal numpi modul instal numpi thi modul alreadi present system that shown here that requir alreadi fulfil have instal requir modul implement part mayavi modul therefor move ahead with implement part mayavi modul python implement implement section will onli mayavi modul implement build function will build spheric harmon function visual through will mayavi modul exampl program understand visual spheric harmon function plot graphic user interfac output will also scipi numpi modul perform scientif calcul use trigonometr function program look follow exampl program implement mayavi modul with numpi scipi modul exampl look follow python program with visual

import linspac meshgrid array sin function from numpi modul then import sph harm function from scipi modul last import mlab from mayavi modul visual spheric harmon motion after that defin angl use linspac function onedtheta onedphi variabl after that defin angl use onedtheta onedphi angl meshgrid function initi twodtheta twodphi variabl after that defin array insid array use ident with angl defin earlier next defin length measur variabl with integ valu then use angl length measur valu insid sph harm function after that have initi radiu variabl defin sphere radiu use function next use
