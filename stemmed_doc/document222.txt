task close event loop when done with run read write data with stream python asyncio modul offer stream which use perform high level network behav server network request best long run network oper where applic block wait some other resourc return result there class streamread streamwrit asyncio these class use read write from network high level read from network need open network use asyncio open connect streamread streamwrit object function return tupl would read write method each connect asyncio start server method use receiv connect from remot host thi function take callback function client connect argument call whenev function receiv request synchron task python have discuss earlier asynchron program run separ sometim would want commun with each other asyncio modul offer queue variou other method establish synchron between task let understand follow implement method queue asyncio queue facilit asynchron function line python object consum other async function exampl workload
