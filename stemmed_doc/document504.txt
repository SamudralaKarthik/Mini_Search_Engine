next prev implement protobuf python thi tutori will learn about googl protobuf implement use python program languag suppos there group number peopl differ origin they speak differ languag commun effect they languag that everyon understand here everyon group will translat their idea into languag they have decid use thi method commun will success convey messag whole group howev thi will result loss effici speed accuraci same situat occur with comput system their compon when interchang inform anoth need transform data into xml json human readabl format that take much time don encod data such where minim data loss increas speed googl came with solut form protobuf will protobuf learn differ from regular data encod let start with introduct protobuf introduct protobuf protobuf develop tech giant googl data transfer profici shrink data block therefor enhanc speed send data techniqu serial data into binari stream fast effici manner design platform nuetral format abstract data into languag use inter machin commun remot procedur call start with protobuf should have knowledg least program languag describ shape data howev best thing about protobuf that support mani program languag such python java javascript etc what protocol buffer they work protocol buffer defin interfac serial structur data establish commun data platform languag independ accord googl offici definit protocol

data like pickl json need protocol buffer python provid pickl that built approach serial data doesn work well with schema evolut also doesn perform properli when need share data with cross languag applic written java serial data becom veri attract sinc sort human readabl there bind librari lot languag also work well data interchang with cross languag applic howev huge space intens encod decod
