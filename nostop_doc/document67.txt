next prev Second Largest Number Python When have elements list, thought finding highest lowest element come mind Python made much easier this article, shall find second largest number Python from list. Sorting list then print second last number. Removing maximum element. Finding maximum element. Traversing list. have look first approach- Sorting list then print second last number following program illustrates Python- Example #program find second largest number list declaring list list_val [20, sorting list list_val.sort() #displaying second last element list print("The second largest element list is:", list_val[-2]) Output: second largest element list It's time explanation part- have declared list from which want take second last element. After this, used sort method that elements list arranged ascending order. make negative indexing since second-largest number will come second last position. second method obtain second largest element list removing maximum element. Removing maximum element Example #program find second largest number list declaring list list_val [20, new_list list1 res_list set(list_val) #removing maximum element res_list.remove(max(res_list)) #printing second largest element print(max(res_list)) Output: Explanation understand what have done above program- have declared list from which want take second last element. After this, used method take unique elements list. make max() maximum value from list then remove After this, print maximum resultant list which will give second-largest number. third method, will loop find second largest number from list. Example declaring empty list list_val user provides number elements added list num_list int(input("Enter number elements list: range(1, num_list 	element int(input("Enter elements: 	list_val.append(element) sort list list_val.sort() print second largest element print("Second largest element is:", list_val[-2]) Output: Enter number elements list: Enter elements: Enter elements: Enter elements: Enter elements: Enter elements: second largest element Explanation have glance what have done here- have declared empty list which will insert elements. After this, user provide number elements would like list. After this, sort method that elements list arranged ascending order. make negative indexing since second-largest number will come second last position. Traversing list last program, will traverse list find largest number then make conditional statements find second largest number from list. following program illustrates same- Example calc_largest(arr): 	second_largest arr[0] 	largest_val arr[0] 	for range(len(arr)): 		if arr[i] largest_val: 			largest_val arr[i] 	for range(len(arr)): 		if arr[i] second_largest arr[i] largest_val: 			second_largest arr[i] 	return second_largest print(calc_largest([20, 10])) Output: Explanation understand what have done above program- first step create function that checks largest number from list traversing next loop, traverse list again finding highest number this time excludes previous since here objective find second largest function. Finally, pass list function. this article, chance think discover some ways develop logic finding second largest number Python. Next TopicDefaultdict Python prev next
