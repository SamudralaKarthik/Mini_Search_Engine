next prev Perform One-Way ANOVA Python? One-Way ANOVA Python One-way ANOVA (also known "analysis variance") test that used determine significant statistical differences between results variety groups. Hypothesis: One-way ANOVA based below alternative null hypotheses. (null hypothesis) formula M2 m3 MK implies that means entire inhabitants same) (null hypothesis) states that distinct population from others will exist most. Statement: Researchers took vehicles identical participate study. vehicles randomly doped with four-engine oils then allowed free ride miles each. After trip, performance each cars recorded. Before proceed, have order SciPy library system. This library installed running following command from terminal: pip3 install scipy Stepwise Implementation Conducting one-way ANOVA tests with Python step-by-stage procedure. steps described following paragraphs: Step Creating data groups. first step make three arrays retain details cars they drive. here performance when each engine applied performance_1 [99, performance_2 [83, performance_3 [79, performance_4 [71, Step Conduct one-way ANOVA: Python offers f_oneway() function SciPy library, with which perform ANOVAs using one-way methods. first, will import f_oneway library fromscipy.stats from scipy.stats import f_oneway FO Here erformance when each engine applied performance_1 [99, performance_2 [83, performance_3 [79, performance_4 [71, Now, will conduct one-way ANOVA FO(performance_1, performance_2, performance_3, performance_4) Output: F_onewayResult(statistic=7.34325396825397, pvalue=0.002591682084345443) Step Analyse results: end, both statistic p-value work same 4.625 well 0.016336498, respectively. p-value can't less than 0.5. Therefore, unable prove null hypothesis. This suggests that have enough evidence conclude improvement performance between four different oils engines. Next TopicTypes inheritance Python prev next
