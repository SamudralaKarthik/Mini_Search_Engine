next prev Python PrimePy Module have learned about prime numbers school days, don't worry have forgotten about them. Prime numbers basically those natural numbers that only divisible themselves, other definition prime number that natural numbers that greater than don't have complete divisible factors other than number itself prime numbers except '2', which only even prime number. prime numbers, except expressed using forms given below: (ii) above-given expressions, natural number. have heard that very easy deal with numbers through programming languages, this because most programming languages provide packages which classify work with numbers types, such integers, natural, other types. Using these programming languages packages inside program makes very easy deal with numbers, classify numbers, work with numbers. Like other programming languages, Python also provides multiple packages which inside Python programs deal work with numbers. Some these packages come in-built source Python, some them require installed when have work with them. PrimePy, module Python, such Python packages about whom have talked above. Using primepy module Python program, work perform many operations prime numbers like finding prime factors number, etc. Therefore, will learn about primepy module this tutorial understand functions Python program work prime well other numbers. Introduction PrimePy Module Python PrimePy Python package module which provides multiple functions that compute multiple operations related directly indirectly prime numbers. biggest advantage this module that using this module, functions prime numbers performed less time. Since Prime numbers don't have factors that's sometimes becomes much difficult work with them. such instances, primepy module becomes very important provides functions that carry these operations prime numbers easily. Installation PrimePy Module have already stated introduction part, some Python modules don't come in-built inside with Python source package. primepy such packages which doesn't come in-built, therefore want work with this module Python, have first install this module device. There multiple installation methods available which install primepy module machine, before choose these methods, should find which easiest simplest Therefore, have installed primepy module system using installer installation method this part tutorial. Using installer method install primepy module simplest easiest method, just have write following command inside terminal shell install this module: install primePy Once write above-given command inside command prompt terminal system, just have press 'enter,' installation primepy module will begin. Now, have only wait some time until dependencies this module successfully installed. see, primepy module successfully installed device, import this module Python programs functions this module work with prime numbers. Implementation PrimePy Module Python primepy module Python programs perform many functions that include direct indirect involvement prime numbers. After importing primepy module into program, functions this module perform required tasks prime numbers. perform following several functions using functions primepy module: Checking Prime Number Return numbers prime number Return first prime numbers Prime numbers between numbers many others will perform these tasks using functions primepy module inside example programs this section, that's will understand implementation primepy module. Implementation Functions Check given Natural Number Prime: primepy module determine given number prime not. PrimePy module provides with check() function, which check number prime not. Following syntax using check() function Python program: prime.check(num) Where given natural number program understand implementation check() function primepy module using this function following example program: Example Look following Python program where find given number prime: Importing prime library from Primepy module from primePy import primes Taking natural numbers user input num1 int(input("Enter first natural number: num2 int(input("Enter second natural number: Checking user input numbers prime res1 pms.check(num1) res2 pms.check(num2) Printing result output print("Is first natural number which entered user input prime? res1) print("Is second number entered user prime? res2) Output: Enter first natural number: Enter second natural number: 673 first natural number which entered user input prime? False second number entered user prime? True see, output printed form true false, stating whether numbers entered user prime not. That's write Python program using check() function primepy module check that given number program prime not. Implementation Printing Prime Factors given Natural Number Program: Using functions primepy module, easily print prime factors output given natural number program. PrimePy module provides with factors() function that example program print prime factors given user input number number given program. Following syntax using factors() function Python program: prime.factors(num) Where given natural number program understand implementation factors() function primepy module print prime factors natural input number using this function following example program: Example Look following program where found printed prime factors given user input numbers result: Importing prime library from Primepy module from primePy import primes Taking natural numbers user input num1 int(input("Enter first natural number: num2 int(input("Enter second natural number: Finding prime factors user input numbers res1 pms.factors(num1) res2 pms.factors(num2) Printing result prime factors output print("All prime factors first number entered user: res1) print("All prime factors second number entered user: res2) Output: Enter first natural number: Enter second natural number: 679 prime factors first number entered user: prime factors second number entered user: see, prime factors both numbers entered user input printed output, that's know prime factors given number. Implementation Printing Lowest First Prime Factor Number: This implementation primepy module works very similarly previous implementation this module. only difference both these implementations that will only print first lowest prime factor number, whereas previously, were printing prime factors given number. primepy module provides with factor(), which print lowest prime factor given number. Following syntax using factor() function Python program: prime.factor(num) Where given natural number program understand implementation factor() function primepy module print first prime factor number using this function following example program: Example Look following program where have used factor() function print lowest first prime factor given input numbers: Importing prime library from Primepy module from primePy import primes Taking natural numbers user input num1 int(input("Enter first natural number: num2 int(input("Enter second natural number: Finding lowest prime factor from user input numbers res1 pms.factor(num1) res2 pms.factor(num2) Printing result lowest prime factor output print("The lowest prime factor first number entered user: res1) print("The first prime factor second number entered user: res2) Output: Enter first natural number: Enter second natural number: 279 lowest prime factor first number entered user: first prime factor second number entered user: see, lowest first prime factor both input numbers printed output, that's factor() function primepy module Python program print lowest prime factor given natural number. Implementation Prime Numbers given Natural Number: Suppose have number given, have find many prime numbers exist which less than equal given number. very hectic time-consuming task calculated manually, that's where take advantage primepy module. primepy module provides option where print prime numbers given number user. this task, primepy module provides with upto() function, which with natural number print prime numbers upto given number. Following syntax using factor() function Python program: prime.upto(num) Where given natural number program understand implementation upto() function primepy module printing prime numbers given number user using this function following example program: Example Look following program where have used upto() function print prime numbers given numbers user input(): Importing prime library from Primepy module from primePy import primes Taking natural numbers user input num1 int(input("Enter first natural number: num2 int(input("Enter second natural number: Finding total prime number upto user input numbers res1 pms.upto(num1) res2 pms.upto(num2) Printing result prime factors output print("Following prime numbers that either less than equal to", num1, given user: res1) print("Following prime numbers that either less than equal to", num2, given user: res2) Output: Enter first natural number: Enter second natural number: Following prime numbers that either less than equal given user Following prime numbers that either less than equal given user see, prime numbers which less than equal input numbers given user printed output. That's upto function print prime numbers upto given natural number. Implementation Printing First Prime Numbers: This implementation primepy module similar previous implementation this module because, both implementations, printing certain prime numbers according given number. Talking particularly about this implementation part, will print first (where natural number) prime numbers, will given number program. primepy module provides with first() function, which print first prime numbers output. Following syntax using first() function Python program: prime.first(num) Where given natural number program understand implementation first() function primepy module print first prime factors using this function following example program: Example Look following program where have used first() function print first prime factors given input number user: Importing prime library from Primepy module from primePy import primes Taking natural number user input num1 int(input("The number first prime numbers want print: Finding total first prime numbers according user input number res1 pms.first(num1) Printing result first prime numbers output print("These first", num1, "prime numbers number entered user: res1) Output: number first prime numbers want print: These first prime numbers number entered user: see, first 'num' (user input numbers program) prime numbers printed output, that's print first 'num' prime numbers. Implementation Getting Prime Numbers that present between given Input Numbers: This implementation part primepy module also very similar implementation this module's upto() function. only difference that here, will find prime numbers between given numbers, whereas previously, were finding prime numbers upto given number prime numbers between given number). performing task find prime numbers present between user input natural numbers, primepy module provides with between() function. Following syntax using this between() function finding prime numbers between given numbers: primes.between(num1, num2) Importing prime library from Primepy module from primePy import primes Taking three natural numbers user input num1 int(input("Enter first natural number: num2 int(input("Enter second natural number: num3 int(input("Enter third natural number: Getting prime numbers which between input numbers res1 pms.between(num1, num2) res2 pms.between(num2, num3) Printing resultant prime numbers output print("These prime numbers which present between first second number given you: res1) print("These prime numbers which present between second third number given you: res2) Output: Enter first natural number: Enter second natural number: Enter third natural number: These prime numbers which present between first second number given you: These prime numbers which present between second third number given you: [41, 73] see, prime numbers that present between given natural numbers user printed output, that's between() function primepy module find print prime numbers between given numbers.
