next prev Python (x,y) Software Python (x,y) engineering scientific development software that absolutely free use. Python (x,y) software used data analysis, data visualization, numerical computations. Python (x,y) based Spyder interactive scientific development environment, Python programming language, (Graphical User Interface) based What with Python (x,y)? With help Python (x,y) software, following tasks analyses: perform tasks simple functional programming (Programming language have MATLAB-like syntax) well tasks powerful object-oriented programming with help Python (x,y) software. even clusters using parallel Python while working with Python (x,y). From simplest Python script most sophisticated application, scientific project developments using Python (x,y) software. Because Qt's Graphical User Interface Spyder scientific development environment, easily scientific project developments with Using Python (x,y) software, various interactive calculations which include symbolling maths (Two-dimensional) well plotting graphs. even parallel computing multi-processor multi-core computers using Python (x,y). Other than above-mentioned tasks, even many more things with Python (x,y) software... History Python (x,y) Pierre Raybaut maintaining, conceiving, developing Python (x,y) software since 2008 with future performance-related goals will discuss later this article). 2011, Gabi Davar joined Python (x,y) project with Pierre Raybaut working project maintainer since then. Later year 2013, Pierre Raybaut moved this project work various other projects. Since 2013, Gabi Davar working primary maintainer Python (x,y) project till now. What Python (x,y) exactly original main purpose Python (x,y) software help scientific programmers project developers were using compiled languages interpreted languages make them switch Python. Python (x,y) scientific developments oriented Python distribution software based Spyder interfaces. Python (x,y) programmers using complied programming language also appreciated reusing their code wrapping software that directly call them Python scripts. Below some important points that should keep mind. IDL registered trademark ITT Visual Information Solutions MATLAB registered trademark MathWorks. directly interfaces Spyder Python (x,y) software plugin page software. download Python (x,y) software look plugins, directly official website given GitHub download using following link: https://python-xy.github.io/downloads.html Main features Python (x,y) Python (x,y) software have features will describe some important features. Users want install uninstall many Python packages present their device simply clicking single button provided Python (x,y) software. Python (x,y) also provides quick user guide about started with Python, Spyder, interfaces. Python (x,y) collect development environment tools well scientific-oriented Python libraries. With help Python (x,y) software, collect almost free related documentations. Python (x,y) software provides all-in-one set-up program which makes easy users their devices. Python (x,y) created? must aware testing libraries, grabbing free documentation present internet choosing right (library well documentation) takes time. Moreover, also need some deep perspective elaborate coherent development framework i.e., Python development environment libraries. That's where need Python (x,y) emerged scientific development. Following some reasons which need Python (x,y) emerged: rapid prototyping using IPython (The enhanced Python shell) Development small projects (application-like projects) using environment provided Spyder (Integrated Development Environment). many scientific development purposes such Numerical simulations, Image processing physics (experimenting well modeling), Signal processing, Scientific computing, Scientific engineering development etc. Python? Python considered more superior scientific language compared other programming language because following reasons: Python open-source free scientific language. Python easily embeddable, extensible, portable. Python fundamentally object-oriented programming language. also general-purpose language e.g., (Input output) rich features, many database libraries, easily available internet, very powerful GUI, only thing generally Python suffers lacks absence much documentation, even though growing community Python contributes every with many great explanatory tutorials every topic. Qt? PyQt very easy-to-use library very powerful therefore strongly recommend (Graphical User Interface) Development. Many scientific programs developments such matplotlib graphic figures etc., easily embedded PyQt application windows very easy MATLAB. Next TopicPython Event-Driven programming prev next
