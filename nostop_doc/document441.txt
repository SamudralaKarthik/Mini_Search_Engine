next prev Android Development using Python Many aspire develop applications; however, most stuck with Java programming language. matter fact say, living reality that cannot know everything this world. fine aware there substitute alternative that talking about here Python programming language that instead Java. Now, doubt might arise possible make Android Application with help Python? definite answer this question Yes. possible develop application based Android using Python. Moreover, technology only limited Python; fact, develop Android applications various programming languages other than Java. interesting fact that Python android much easier than Java much better when comes complexity. understand depth. primary thing understand that different programming languages Android application development. These languages include Java, Kotlin, C++, Python, Lua, Corona, HTML5, JavaScript, various others. Moreover, these languages easy understand use. There various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that Android Development. environment that allows programmers develop applications, this case, Android applications. this tutorial, will discovering interesting facts about Android Development with help Python programming language. begin understanding Python brief. What Python programming language? Python famous object-oriented high-level programming language. Python created Guido Rossum released year 1991. simple language that easy learn understand. Python work Windows, Linux, MacOS, Raspberry others. works interpreter system, which means easily execute code soon write Python quick language providing much easier syntax than other language. Android Application with Python Since android applications operated Android Operating System start developing Android applications using Python, need platforms that allow write codes completely Python. Fortunately, various platforms allow developers development, development, analysis, computation scientific numeric data software development. Some platforms used Android Development using Python follows: QPython QPython script engine that executes Python Android devices. consists Python interpreter, console, editor, SL4A Library Android development. lets Android device scripts projects based Python. PySide Pyside Python library that allows programmers create cross-platform graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Python binding framework. library among most powerful libraries. developed Digia Project. PyMob PyMob open-source software library used assess atomic mobility parameters CALPHAD-type Kinetic Databases with help data, which experimental tracer diffusion coefficients. software consists entirely automated assessment procedure. Pyqtdeploy Pyqtdeploy utility that allows deployment PyQt applications written with Python v3.5 above conjunction with other utilities offered with QT. supports deployment desktop platforms (like Linux, Windows, MacOS) mobile platforms (like Android iOS). Kivy Kivy free open-source Python framework used develop mobile applications other multi-touch application software using natural user interface. distributed under terms License work Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows. Apart from these above, some other tools support developers writing code that work Android Operating System. these platforms generate native source code their supported platforms. native code that generated identical hand-written script, easily optimized using native compilers. Some Problems Developing Android Apps using Python know that Java official programming language Android, Google declared Java Android like that Standard Android, other languages that utilize might mark Java. Though Android development using Python possible, won't efficient developing Android applications using Java. Some problems that might arise follows: These frameworks might support every feature Android operating system. cannot utilize tools always. These codes might very fast they generate native code first, which then optimized with help native compilers. Sometimes High-level graphics might supported, times graphic support also present.
