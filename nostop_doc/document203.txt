next prev Python Program Print Pascal Triangle this tutorial, will discuss print Pascal triangle using Python program. first, let's understand what Pascal triangle Introduction Pascal triangle exciting concept mathematics where triangular array formed summing adjacent elements preceding row. simple words, every number generated taking adjacent row, outside edges triangle always named after famous French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Below representation Pascal triangle. above image, first line second line contains one, third line which formed taking above line. follows alternate pattern entire triangle Algorithm Print Pascal's Triangle Python Below step used print Pascal triangle. Step Taking input from user number rows. Step Declare empty list that will store values. Step Using loop, which will iterate through append sub-lists list. Step append list. Step Now, loop define value number inside triangle adjacent row. Step Print Pascal triangle according format. Step Exit Let's understand following implementation algorithm into Python program. Program int(input("Enter number: list1 #an empty list range(num): list1.append([]) list1[i].append(1) range(1, list1[i].append(list1[i 1][j list1[i 1][j]) if(num list1[i].append(1) range(num): print(" (num i), range(0, print('{0:6}'.format(list1[i][j]), print() Output: Case Enter number: program more time. Case Enter number: Explanation above program, have taken several rows from user input. have declared empty list. Then used loop, which appended sub-list into empty list. next appended sub-lists. inner loop defined number inside triangle above adjacent row. end, have used loop print Pascal's triangle according format. Method another method following binomial coefficient, line starts with entry number line Binomial Coefficient C(line, i). formula given below. C(line, C(line, i-1) (line Example input int(input("Enter number rows:")) range(1, n+1): range(0, n-i+1): print(' end='') first element always range(1, i+1): first value line always print(' sep='', end='') using Binomial Coefficient print() above method's time complexity 0(N2). Method This method optimized printing Pascal triangle. This method based power 11**0 11**1 11**2 11**3 1331 Example input int(input("Enter number rows:")) iterarte upto range(n): adjust space print(' '*(n-i), end='') compute power print(' '.join(map(str, str(11**i)))) Output: Case Enter number rows: Case Enter number rows: above code when enter number rows five. gave wrong output. That means works upto n< only. takes less time execute 0(N). Next TopicNamedTuple Python prev next
