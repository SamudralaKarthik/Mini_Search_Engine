next prev Python Program Print Prime Factor Given Number this tutorial, will discuss prime factor given number using Python program. familiar with prime numbers, then prime numbers number that divided itself. example …… Finding prime factorization number user enters number then output must '2, input 315; output should "3 7". program must return prime prime factor given number. prime factors Therefore most significant prime factor 330. Example: Before writing Python program, let's understand following conjectures. Conjecture There at-least prime factor that would less than √n case prime number. Proof -There greater sqrt(n) numbers, then their product should also divide which will exceed which contradicts assumption. there more than prime factor greater than sqrt(n). Let's following step perform such operation. sqrt(n} sqrt(n) Conjecture There AT-MOST prime factor greater than sqrt(n). Proof Suppose there greater sqrt(n) number then their product should also divide which will exceed which contradicts assumption. there more than prime factor greater than sqrt(n). Let's following step perform such operation. Example Python program print prime factors import math Below function will print prime factor given number prime_factors(num): Using while loop, will print number two's that divide while print(2,) range(3, int(math.sqrt(num)) while divides print divide while print(i,) print(num) calling function prime_factors(num) Output: Explanation above code, have imported math module. prime_factor() function responsible printing composite number. First, even numbers; after this, remaining prime factors must odd. loop, must odd, incremented two. loop will square root times. Let's understand following property composite numbers. Every composite number least prime factor less than equal square root. program will work follows. first step, find least prime factor occurrence will removed from repeatedly dividing Repeat above both steps dividing Both steps will repetitive till become either prime number. Let's understand another example where find largest prime factor given number. Example Python program find largest prime factor given number. largest_prime_factor(n): while else: return print(largest_prime_factor(345)) Output: Next TopicPython Program Print Pascal Triangle prev next
