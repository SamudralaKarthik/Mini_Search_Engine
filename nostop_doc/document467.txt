next prev Python Pronouncing Module never easy find rhyming words given word, this becomes even more difficult when writing poem some rhyming paragraph. Many have heard pronouncing dictionary helpful producing rhyming words. those don't know what dictionary open-source pronouncing dictionary that anyone finding rhyming words, Speech Group created Carnegie Mellon University. Since open-source dictionary, anyone free, basically designed speech recognition research. don't have idea rhyming words given word looking them, this dictionary, which absolutely free. This dictionary provides with rhyming words available word from English language. just have visit their website type given word search box; result will displayed with rhyming words given word search box. Thus, becomes very easy find rhyming words given word, don't have spend much time thinking about rhyming words. Many programming languages also offer packages that used, like pronouncing dictionary find rhyming words given word English language. Talking specifically about Python, pronouncing package, which very simple interface pronouncing dictionary, this package Python program find rhyming words word given program. Therefore, will learn about this pronouncing module Python this tutorial. will learn about installation this module find rhyming words given word program. Introduction Pronouncing Module Python Pronouncing module library simple interface pronouncing dictionary Python which anyone finding rhyming words performing other operations that perform using pronouncing dictionary. There already many packages available Python that used find rhyming words, best part this module that doesn't require external dependencies while performing operations, very easy use. pronouncing module Python created that pronouncing dictionary's interface from Python program without having install NLTK grand behemoth. Using functions this module very easy, easily this module Python program find rhyming words given word program. This module saves lots time which waste while manually thinking looking rhyming words given word. just have functions this module Python program, rhyming words related given word will displayed output. Pronouncing Module Python: Installation pronouncing module Python in-built module Python which means that doesn't come pre-installed system when installed Python source machine. This module requires installed externally, that's have perform installation process installing this module system. Like using this module, installing also very easy because don't have external dependencies this module. install pronouncing module Python using multiple installation processes installing using installer method simplest easiest one. Therefore, this part, going install this module using installer method, this installation method, have write down following command command prompt shell system: install pronouncing After writing installation command mentioned above, just have press 'enter' key, installation pronouncing module will begin. When installation process this module starts, will have wait some time because completion this module's installation will take while. see, pronouncing module Python successfully installed system, 'successfully installed' displayed command prompt shell's screen. Now, import pronouncing module Python program functions find rhyming words given word program using these functions. Pronouncing Module Python: Implementation Now, will learn this module functions functions this module find rhyming words given word. will understand implementation this module importing using these functions example programs. will functions this module example program find rhyming words word given that example program. will this module's rhymes() function carry this operation. Following syntax using rhymes() function pronouncing module: pronouncing.rhymes("GivenWord") see, rhymes() function takes given word (whose rhymed words will displayed result) argument. Look following example program understand implementation this pronouncing module: Example Look following Python program where find rhyming words using pronouncing module: Importing pronouncing module import pronouncing Using rhymes() finding rhyming words rhymResult prn.rhymes("Shine") Printing result output print("The rhyming words word Shine are: print(rhymResult) Output: rhyming words word Shine are: ['affine', 'align', 'aline', 'assign', 'barentine', 'vine', 'whine', 'whine', 'wine', 'wyne', 'zine'] see, rhyming words word 'Shine' printed output, that's this module print rhyming words given word. Explanation: First, have imported pronouncing module program this module's rhymes() function. After that, used rhymes() function used 'Shine' word that rhyming words related 'shine' word will fetched. have stored result this operation rhymResult variable that this variable print result. Lastly, used print statement with rhymResult variable print rhyming words related 'Shine' output result operation performed function. Taking word input from user finding rhyming words: following program, will perform same operation have performed first example program, here, will take given word input from user. Look following example program understand this implementation: Importing pronouncing module import pronouncing Taking given word input from user givenWord input("Please Enter word find rhyming words: Using rhymes() finding rhyming words oprResult prn.rhymes(givenWord) Printing result output print("The rhyming words word given are: print(oprResult) Output: Please enter word find rhyming words: Meta rhyming words word given are: ['akita', 'alita', 'alvita', 'amelita', 'amezquita', ....., ita', 'tita', 'tomita', 'unita', 'velveeta', 'venita', 'vernita', 'vinita', 'yamashita', 'zita'] Next TopicPython PyAutoGUI Module prev next
