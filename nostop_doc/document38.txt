next prev Python Assert Keyword Python assert keyword defined debugging tool that tests condition. Assertions mainly assumption that asserts state fact confidently program. example, while writing division function, divisor should zero, assert that divisor equal zero. merely Boolean expression that condition expression checks condition returns true false. true, program does anything, moves next line code. false, raises AssertionError exception with optional error message. main task assertions inform developers about unrecoverable errors program like "file found", right that assertions internal self-checks program. most essential testing quality assurance application development area. syntax assert keyword given below. Syntax assert condition, error_message(optional) Assertion used debugging tool, primary task check condition. finds that condition true, moves next line code, not, then stops operations throws error. points error code. Where Assertion Python used Checking outputs functions. Used testing code. checking values arguments.Checking valid input. Example1 This example shows working assert with error message. avg(scores): assert len(scores) 0,"The List empty." return sum(scores)/len(scores) scores2 [67,59,86,75,92] print("The Average scores2:",avg(scores2)) scores1 print("The Average scores1:",avg(scores1)) Output: Average scores2: 75.8 AssertionError: List empty. Explanation: above example, have passed non-empty list scores2 empty list scores1 avg() function. received output scores2 list successfully, after that, error AssertionError: List empty. assert condition satisfied scores2 list lets program continue run. However, scores1 doesn't satisfy condition gives AssertionError. Example2: This example shows "Divide error" console. initializing number uses assert check print ("x value assert "Divide error" print Output: value Runtime Exception Traceback (most recent call last): File "main.py", line <module> assert "Divide error" AssertionError: Divide error Explanation: above example, have initialized integer variable, i.e., x=7, y=0, print value x/y output. Python interpreter generated Runtime Exception because assert keyword found divisor zero then displayed "Divide error" console. Next TopicPython List Comprehension prev next
