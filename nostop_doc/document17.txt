next prev Python continue Statement this tutorial, we'll look Python continue keyword skip remaining statements current loop next iteration. Also, difference between continue pass keywords. Application Continue Statement Python, loops repeat processes their efficient way. However, there might occasions when wish leave current loop entirely, skip iteration, dismiss condition controlling loop. Loop control statements such cases. continue keyword loop control statement that allows change loop's control. continue Keyword Python, continue keyword return control iteration beginning Python loop Python while loop. remaining lines prevailing iteration loop skipped continue keyword, which returns execution beginning next iteration loop. Both Python while Python loops leverage continue statements. Example Python Continue Statements Loop Assume following scenario: want develop program that returns numbers from mentioned that must perform this with 'for' loop. Here's when continue keyword comes into play. will execute loop from test condition that iterator equal equals we'll employ continue statement skip following iteration displaying output; otherwise, loop will print result. following code example above scenario: Code Python code show example continue statement looping from iterator range(10, 21): iterator equals loop will continue next iteration iterator continue otherwise printing value iterator print( iterator Output: will repeat above code, this time with string. will take string "Javatpoint" print each letter string except "a". This time will Python while loop Until value iterator less than string's length, while loop will keep executing. Code Creating string string "JavaTpoint" initializing iterator iterator starting while loop while iterator len(string): loop letter will skip remaining code next iteration string[iterator] 'a': continue otherwise will print letter print(string[ iterator iterator Output: Python Continue Pass Usually, there some confusion pass continue keywords. here differences between these two. Headings continue pass Definition continue statement utilized skip current loop's remaining statements, following iteration, return control beginning. pass keyword used when phrase necessary syntactically placed executed. Action takes control back start loop. Nothing happens Python interpreter encounters pass statement. Application works with both Python while Python loops. performs nothing; hence null operation. Syntax following syntax: -: continue syntax follows:- pass Interpretation It's mostly utilized within loop's condition. During byte-compile stage, pass keyword removed. Next TopicPython Pass prev next
