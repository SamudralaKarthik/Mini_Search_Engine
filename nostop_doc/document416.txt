next prev Inconsistent tabs spaces indentation word indentation here refers number spaces tabs while beginning statement block code. these whitespaces tabs must match while certain code block ends; thus, refers proper indentation particular block. indentation used python programming language plays very important role. initialize block code begin certain block code, indentation used identify that block code. other programming languages like C++, Java, many more, indentation does matter starting code block. Instead indentation, these languages curly brackets denote code block. python programming language, indentation matters. whole code running process start only with matching indented block. python programming language, have concept main function when compared with other programming languages, like C++, Java, initial block code does contain white spaces tabs, ultimately denoting main function; after onwards, requirement programmer. They will if-else, loop many more indentation vary accordingly. name suggests, inconsistent spaces tabs indentation generates syntax error. When code particular programming language, need remember syntax accordingly; hence, apply unnecessary white spaces. unnecessary whitespace tabs, will generate particular errors accordingly. talk about python programming language, more concerned about proper indentation right whitespaces tabs accessing code. talk about programming language, more concerned about proper brackets particular place wherever required starting closing certain blocks code. suppose unnecessary whitespaces tabs language. that case, ignored compiler because predefined working compiler, that will ignore whitespaces comments while executing program. does indentation work Python? indentation term here refers matching number tabs whitespaces used before starting block code certain block code because ultimately represents block code. Similarly, this way, nested code blocks, indentation that block codes refer from block block. talk about starting block, there whitespace tab, when move further upcoming second block code, whitespaces. While starting certain block code, ending, will same apply whitespaces, which indicates ending that block code. want include more nested blocks code, will apply more whitespaces than previous block code, which indicates starting next nested block code. will apply same number whitespaces have done starting that block code ending. Similarly, this way, more nested blocks, starting each block will differ number whitespaces used represent particular block code. nested block codes while going nested inside, number whitespaces tabs increased. Python programming language, indentation each block code plays very important role indicating particular code block. What happens when inconsistent whitespaces tabs? talk about python programming language, when inconsistently apply number whitespaces even unnecessary places that were required, will ultimately generate indentation error. indentation error will occur when start block code properly, while ending will irregular several whitespaces tabs indicating that particular block code; hence will generate error unmatched number whitespaces tabs. talk about programming language, number whitespaces tabs immaterial; does generate error because compiler ignores sometimes, generate unusual things while running scanf function applying extra whitespace; will understand discussing more detail. rectify inconsistency code unnecessary whitespaces tabs? rectify error, have follow steps that mentioned below: Identify line code that generating error. Observe line find corresponding block code. Match number whitespaces used starting that block code counting whitespaces tabs. Count number whitespaces used particular code block; does match, then rectify applying proper number whitespaces tabs. still error resolved, then match indentation target block code with above below block code. matching similarly above check number whitespaces used starting each block code. must contain difference whitespaces. these nested else randomly matching number whitespaces rectifies corresponding indentation error. Examples inconsistent tabs whitespaces understand more detail with help examples: Example Python Program find smallest number from given number n=int(input("Enter number count while( This loop will count number digits present given number count count count [int(i) str(n)] This loop will allocate each digits seperately list minodd 10000 minodd This condition will find minimum digit present array, minodd minodd 10000 case smallest digit found then will assign minodd, which indicates digit found minodd print("Minimum number found minodd output above program: above-highlighted block will generate indentation error unmatched number whitespaces tabs while starting that code block with ending. Even nested indentation will affect above block code. IndentationError: expected indented block Correction example Python Program find smallest number from given number n=int(input("Enter number count while( This loop will count number digits present given number count count count [int(i) str(n)] This loop will allocate each digits seperately list minodd 10000 minodd This condition will find minimum digit present array, minodd minodd 10000 case smallest digit found then will assign minodd, which indicates digit found minodd print("Minimum number found minodd output above program: above program will perfectly work error been rectified matching number whitespaces tabs used represent certain code block.
