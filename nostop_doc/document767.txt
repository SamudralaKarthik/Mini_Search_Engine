next prev Google Search Packages using Python this tutorial, will learn about Python's current Google search packages. will discover usage libraries most used Google search libraries. will also learn about search queries over Google using Python code. Python provides many libraries Google search, their documentation quite complex poorly written. This tutorial will guide Google search libraries simple way. Let's have introduction libraries. Google Search Google most popular widely used search engine across world. unlocks information from corners internet within just milliseconds. Last years, have relied standard method query information ranging from news articles research topics. There reasons search internet Solving problems with stack overflow Data Mining Data mining examining large data sets extract information insights. method mining data from internet known mining. mining divided into three parts Content Mining, Usage Mining Structure Mining. mining preferred method retrieving data using Google search retrieve URLs scraping purposes. this article's purpose, will focus only retrieval process now. work with google library, need install google library. will following example install google will perform essential search operation. example, company "Apple" topic "iPhone" retrieve news articles. from googlesearch import search query "Matrix" my_results_list search(query, query want 'com', level domain lang 'en', language Number results page start First result retrieve stop None, Last result retrieve pause 2.0, Lapse between HTTP requests my_results_list.append(i) print(i) Output: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Resurrections https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Revolutions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_(The_Matrix) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)#Films https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)#Cast_and_crew https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)#Reception https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)#Influences_and_interpretations https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/matrix https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKQi3bBA1y8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ix7TUGVYIo https://www.matrixcomsec.com/ https://www.britannica.com/science/matrix-mathematics https://www.amazon.com/Matrix-Keanu-Reeves/dp/B000GJPL1S https://www.matrix-globalservices.com/ https://www.matrix.in/ https://matrix.org/ https://www.matrixres.com/ https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/matrix https://www.matrixpartners.in/ https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/matrix https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/matrix https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/matrix https://www.matrixaccesscontrol.com/ https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Matrix.html https://www.dictionary.com/browse/matrix https://www.netflix.com/in/title/20557937 above code will display URLs over Google related Matrix. google search verify result manually. above function takes following arguments query string that want search over Google. stands top-level domain, which means want search result google.com google, some other domain. lang represents language. displays number results want. start first result retrieve. stop last result retrieve. pass None will search forever. pause shows lapse wait between HTTP requests. lapse short, Google block IP. Keeping significant lapses will slow your program, safe better option. Return iterates found URLs. stop parameter none iterator will loop forever. understand source code more details googlesearch library, visit official repository. Google Google Python library used perform google searches efficiently. works similarly other google libraries; scraps data from Google. Note recommended multiple times since involves scraping. install this library following command terminal. install git+https://github.com/abenassi/Google-Search-API Now, let's some simple search using googlesearchapi. Example from googleapi import google search_results google.search("Taylor Swift") print(search_results) Output [GoogleResult(name=Taylor Swift Homewww.taylorswift.com description=taylor swift willow (official music video) RsEZ.., GoogleResult(name=Taylor Swift Wikipediaen.wikipedia.org wiki Taylo.. description=Taylor Alison Swift (born December 1989) a.., GoogleResult(name=Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) Instagram photos vide.. description=142.1m Followers, Following, 486 Posts In.., GoogleResult(name=Taylor Swift Home Facebookwww.facebook.com description=Taylor Swift. 70978350 likes 788642 talking abo.., GoogleResult(name=Taylor Swift Billboardwww.billboard.com music tay.. description=Not content merely country superstar, Tay.., GoogleResult(name=Taylor Swift: Evermore review songwriter ag.. description=10 hours Swift songwriter ages.., GoogleResult(name=Taylor Swift Spotifyopen.spotify.com artist description=Taylor Swift, Category: Artist, Albums: evermore,..] googleapi prompts only source link also appends result with name description well. According developers, this library development phase; more features come. Currency Conversion googlesearchapi also allows convert currency. means, currency converter through Python code. Let's understand following example Example from googleapi import google rupees google.convert_currency(5.0, "USD", "RS") print("5.0 RS".format(rupees)) Output: 397.55 rupees with other currencies. Conclusion This tutorial includes essential libraries google search APIs. Using these API, search query using Python code. free explore these libraries them according requirements. This tutorial's motive familiarize with google search library. Next TopicKMP Algorithm Implementation Algorithm using Python prev next
