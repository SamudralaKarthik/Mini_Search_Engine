next prev Morphological Operations Image Processing Python Morphological operations used extracting image components that helpful description representation shape region. Morphological operations fundamental tasks that dependent image shape. typically takes place binary images. requires sources data, first which input image, second known structuring component. Morphological operators able take input image well structuring component input. elements then combined with operators. objects image input treated based characteristics shape image. These encoded structuring part. Opening similar erosion, removes bright foreground pixels from edges foreground pixels. result this operation secure foreground region, which similar structuring component even completely contains structuring component while taking away other regions foreground pixels. opening operation utilized removal internal noise within image. Opening erosion operation that followed dilation. Required modules libraries: perform morphological operation image processing, will need following module: Install: !pip3 install NumPy Install: !pip3 install numpy Syntax: Syntax cv2morphology cv2.morphologyEx(image, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel) Parameters: image: takes input Image array. MORPH_OPEN: used applying Morphological Opening operation. kernel: used structuring element. Here below Python code explaining Opening Morphological Operation Code: First, will import required libraries: import import numpy here, will return video from first webcam computer. screenRead1 CV.VideoCapture(0) now, will loop runs capturing been initialized. while(1): now, reading frames from camera image screenRead1.read() Converting color space because OCV only reads colors BGR frame converted CV.cvtColor(image, CV.COLOR_BGR2HSV) here, will define range masking blue_1 nmp.array([111, 52]) blue_2 n,p.array([131, 257, 257]) Now, will initialize mask forconvoluting over input image mask CV.inRange(hsv, blue_1, blue_2) then, will pass bitwise_and over each pixel convoluted CV.bitwise_and(image, image, mask mask) Here, will define kernel that Structuring element kernel nmp.ones((5, nmp.uint8) Now, will define opening function over image structuring element opening CV.morphologyEx(mask, CV.MORPH_OPEN, kernel) mask opening operation shown window CV.imshow('Mask', mask) CV.imshow('Opening', opening) Now, will wait stop program CV.waitKey(1) 0xFF ord('a'): break De-allocate associated memory usage CV.destroyAllWindows() last, will close window Release webcam screenRead.release() Output Input image Mask: Output Frame system recognizes designated blue book input removes eliminates noise inside area interest with Opening function.
