next prev Python program find compound interest this tutorial, will learn write Python program find compound interest given value. Before proceed with writing program, let's first under basics compound interest. Compound interest addition interest given principal value deposit loan called compound interest, also known interest interest. Compound interest basically result reinvesting gained interest principal value, rather than taking paying out, which will result next period interest; paid interest will added principal amount. Let's compare compound interest simple interest. that, simple interest, there compounding interest principal values, gained interest remains same every cycle. Fact: Compound interest standard method interest calculation banking, finance, economics. formula compound interest: general mathematical formula calculating compound interest given principal value, i.e., given below: Total Amount P(1+r/100)tp above formula, variables have used described given below: Total amount Principal value Compound interest gained Principal value Time period which Principal value invested Rate interest Code Implementation Till now, have learned basics compound interest important daily life. have also learned about basic formula that calculating Compound interest certain principal value. Now, this section, will write Python program calculate compound interest given certain value. writing required Python program, have follow certain steps, which given below: Step will take principal amount user input. Step Then, user rate interest time period which principal amount invested. Step After taking three required variables from user, will compound interest formula, i.e., "Total Amount P(1+r/100)tp," these variables program. Step will store result 'Result variable'. Step last, will print compound interest result output program. Now, look following Python program better understand implementation above given steps: Example Using default function compound_rate(PV, CRate, tp): Using formula TotalAmount (pow ((1 CRate 100), tp)) Calculating CInterest TotalAmount Printing result output print("Total return value after completion given time period: TotalAmount) print("Compound interest gained given amount is", CInterest) Taking principal amount value from user float(input("Enter principal amount: CRate float(input("Enter rate compound interest: taking interest rate value float(input("Enter time period which principal invested: taking time period value Calling function compound_rate(PV, CRate, tp) Output: Enter principal amount: 600000 Enter rate compound interest: Enter time period which principal invested: Total return value after completion given time period: 1022257.0687807774 Compound interest gained given amount 422257.0687807774 Explanation After running above program, have given three required variables, i.e., 600000, Crate 2.7, total compound interest total value (1022257.0687807774) that will given principal value printed result output. calculate compound interest given amount rate interest time period using this program.
