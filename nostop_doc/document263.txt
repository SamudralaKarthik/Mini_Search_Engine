next prev Ansible Python following tutorial, will understand Ansible along with benefits Ansible Python. Introduction Ansible Ansible open-source platform automation tool utilized perform tasks like deploying applications, managing configurations, orchestrating intra-service, provisioning. Automation time passes with highly complex environment Information Technologies that often require scale quickly developers system administrators order work along they perform every function manually. Automation helps simplifying intricate tasks makes works developers much manageable. also allows developers focus attention other activities that include values organization. other terms, Automation increases efficiency freeing time. Ansible, stated above, among swiftly rising tools Automation. What Ansible? Ansible push-based Infrastructure code (IaC) that provides user-friendly domain-specific language define architecture desire declarative way. term push-based signifies that Ansible utilizes communicate among machine executing Ansible machines where configurations being applied. machines working with Ansible that like configure known managed nodes Ansible hosts. terms Ansible, list hosts known inventory. machine reading definition files executing Ansible order push configuration host known control node. Ansible written Python programming language quite minimal learning curve. procedure Ansible pretty simple doesn't rely extra application, servers, client daemons. Ansible based principle embracing interrelation architecture system. Like other tools used managing configuration (such Puppet, Chef, Salt), works with types servers: controlling machines nodes. Ansible uses small programs known Ansible Modules order orchestrate nodes. These modules resource models chosen system state executed over SSH. need agents extra custom security infrastructure this purpose. library modules exist machine. modules perform tasks using JSON protocol over standard output write convenient code programming language, including Python. system utilizes YAML Ansible playbooks format order describe work Automation. This way, machine well human-friendly. when nodes being managed Ansible, doesn't consume resources since neither programs daemons running background. Some Benefits Ansible Being powerful automation engine, Ansible helps developers deploying software more efficiently. avoid agents, custom code, custom scripting mainly focus security, easy audibility, review, rewriting content. There numerous advantages Ansible over similar platforms used software automation. Some these advantages described below: Simplicity:Ansible provides simplicity developers require writing scripts custom code deployment applications updating them. allows Automation language approaching plain English. easy developers, system administrators, managers read, manage speed their projects programs. Completeness:Ansible also provides completeness comes combined with different complex tools managing configuration, deploying applications, orchestrating workflow, even cloud provisioning single system. Modules help automating nearly everything out-of-the-box, extra application required. Secureness:Ansible utilizes SSH, doesn't deploy vulnerable agents nodes doesn't require daemons root-level extra ports. Ansibles offers agentless environment that helps improving security usable non-root. Ansible features in-built authentication Operating System, support LDAP, SSSD, Kerberos. Understanding Python Ansible Purpose call Ansible code using Python using Application Programming Interface (API) Ansible. Ansible released version that allows better integration with different programming languages. quite significant aspect note that Ansible extended capability order support development with help Python; however, also mentioned website that also stop supporting framework basis discretion (creating even fixing current version API). There different methods available developers utilize Ansible from Application Programming Interface (API) perspective. utilize Ansible Python programming language that allows control nodes. extend Ansible respond different events Python, write plugins plugin inventory data from external sources data. Note: This envisioned internal Ansible. Ansible make alterations this time that could break backward compatibility with API's older versions. this, Ansible does support Python external use. want utilize Python only execute modules playbooks, first all, will consider ansible-runner.
