next prev Python Program Find Number Days Between Given Dates this tutorial, will discuss write Python program find number days between given numbers. Suppose have given dates expected output would Example: Input: Date_1 12/10/2021, Date_2 31/08/2022 Output: Number Days between given Dates are: days Input: Date_1 10/09/2023, Date_2 04/02/2025 Output: Number Days between given Dates are: days: days Method Naïve Approach this approach, naïve solution will start from date_1, will keep counting number days until reaches date_2. This solution will require more than O(1) times. simple solution counting total number days before date_1, which means will count total days from 00/00/0000 date_1, then will count total number days before date_2. last, will return difference between counts form total days between given dates. Example: First, will create class dates class date_n: __init__(self, day, month, year): self.day self.month month self.year year storng number days months from January December. month_Days [31, This function will count number leap years from 00/00/0000 #given date count_Leap_Years(day): years day.year Now, will check current year should considered count leap years not. (day.month years condition year leap year: te year multiple multiple multiple 100. return int(years int(years 100) int(years 400) This function will return number days between given dates get_difference(date_1, date_2): Now, will count total number days before first date "date_1" Then, will initialize count using years date_1.year date_1.day then, will days months given date range(0, date_1.month month_Days[K] every leap year days, will every leap year count_Leap_Years(date_1) SIMILARLY, will count total number days before second date "date_2" date_2.year date_2.day range(0, date_2.month month_Days[K] count_Leap_Years(date_2) Then, will return difference between counts return (n_2 n_1) Driver program date_1 date_n(12, 2021) date_2 date_n(30, 2022) print ("Number Days between given Dates are: get_difference(date_1, date_2), "days") Output: Number Days between given Dates are: days Method using Python datetime module this method, will built_in function Python "datetime", which help users solving various date-time related problems. finding difference between dates, input dates date type format subtract them, this will result output number days between given dates. Example: from datetime import date date_n number_of_days(date_1, date_2): return (date_2 date_1).days Driver program date_1 date_n(2023, date_2 date_n(2025, print ("Number Days between given Dates are: number_of_days(date_1, date_2), "days") Output: Number Days between given Dates are: days Conclusion this tutorial, have discussed different methods write python code find total number days between given dates.
