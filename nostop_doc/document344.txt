Syntax syntax using fabs Python math.fabs(x) It's time have look some programs better understanding. Program first program, will discuss basics fabs method. #working fabs() import math initializing variables -20.3 -30.66 19.13 #printing values print ("The fabs math.fabs(a)) print ("The fabs math.fabs(b)) print ("The fabs math.fabs(c)) Output: fabs 20.3 fabs 30.66 fabs 19.13 Explanation: Let's have look explanation this program- Since have fabs(), have imported math module. After this, have initialized variables with positive negative values. next step, have passed these values fabs() printed them. executing program, displays desired output. Program next program, will perform some basic operations these numbers that involve usage fabs(). following program illustrates same- #working fabs() import math initializing variables -20.3 -30.66 19.13 calculating print ("The print ("The printing values math.fabs(a) math.fabs(b) math.fabs(c) #calculating after fabs print ("The print ("The Output: -50.96 -11.530000000000001 50.96 49.79 Explanation: what have done above program- Since have fabs(), have imported math module. After this, have initialized variables with positive negative values. next step, have printed have passed these three variables fabs() stored returned values variables have calculated again check difference between results obtained using values that were used evaluation before after passing into fabs. executing program, displays desired output. Program Finally, last program, will perform more mathematical operation numbers. #working fabs() import math #initialising variables -20.3 -30.66 19.13 #calculating product print ("The product print ("The product #printing values math.fabs(a) math.fabs(b) math.fabs(c) #calculating product after fabs print ("The product print ("The product Output: product 622.398 product -586.5258 product 622.398 product 586.5258 Explanation: Let's have look explanation this program- Since have fabs(), have imported math module. After this, have initialized variables with positive negative values. next step, have printed product have passed these three variables fabs() stored returned values variables have calculated product again check difference between results obtained using values that were used evaluation before after passing into fabs. executing program, displays desired output. Conclusion this Tutorial, learned fabs() they used Python programs make work much easier. Next TopicHow Remove Decimal Python prev next
