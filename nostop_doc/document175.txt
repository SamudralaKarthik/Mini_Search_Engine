next prev Python JavaScript Python JavaScript both extremely powerful programming languages with wide range real-world applications. Python programming language that used creation various other uses, like scientific research. JavaScript used primarily front-end back-end mobile development. This article will discuss differences between Python JavaScript. Before making comparison, will know about Python JavaScript. What Python? Python dynamically semantic, interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. It's built-in data structure with dynamic binding dynamic typing high level. serves scripting glue language connecting existing components creating Rapid Application. simple, easy-to-understand syntax that emphasizes readability, lowering software maintenance costs. supports modules packages allowing programs more modular reusable. Python interpreter robust standard library free distribute source binary form major platforms. first developed late 1980s Guido Rossum released 1991. advanced open-source programming language facilitating public debate Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). Advantages Disadvantages Python Various advantages disadvantages Python follows: Advantages object-oriented programming language that used develop rapid applications. syntax very simple compared Java, C++. runs several types operating systems computers, like Windows, macOS, Linux. auto-installed shell. extensive library handy tools developers. comes with various prebuilt libraries that make development task very easy. interactive shell that allows evaluate items before they implemented. comes with huge standard library support wide range common programming tasks. Disadvantages only used platforms. weak mobile computing, used development. commercial support. under-developed primitive database access layer. Since Python dynamic, generates more errors during execution. What JavaScript? JavaScript lightweight, object-oriented scripting language that used build dynamic HTML pages with interactive effects webpage. JavaScript also commonly used game development mobile development. interpreted scripting language, code only executed browser. Node.js execute code outside browser. It's also known browser's language, used both client-side server-side development. Brendan Eich Netscape created first published 1995. language originally known LiveScript before being renamed JavaScript. JavaScript's syntax heavily influenced programming language extension JavaScript filename .js. Advantages disadvantages JavaScript Various advantages disadvantages JavaScript follows: Advantages open-source project. allows cross-compilation. supports interfaces, modules, classes. used both client-side server-side. allows build interfaces that react whenever user hovers mouse over them. browser. extend JavaScript writing large applications. Disadvantages cannot used develop networking applications there support networking apps. Client-side JavaScript doesn't support writing reading files. been only keeping security purposes. only supports single inheritance, multiple inheritances. Some programs might required this object-oriented language feature. Main differences between Python JavaScript Here, going discuss differences between Python JavaScript: Python strongly typed, with implicit form conversions, whereas JavaScript weakly typed. Python better-designed language that easier maintain than JavaScript. Python supports wide range numerical data types, including int, float, fixed-point decimal, while Java-Script mostly deals with floating-point variables. Python object-based programming similar JavaScript supports programming style that used basic functions variables. Python uses Self-argument first argument each function, while JavaScript uses "this" function access object. JavaScript, synchronous blocking programming common, while Python default de-facto. Python number libraries machine learning, data analytics, scientific computing that JavaScript does have. Python mainly used server-side programming, while JavaScript runs both server browser. Python easy start programming than JavaScript. Python slow execute program than JavaScript. JavaScript uses ";" statement terminator while Python does not. JavaScript ideal mobile application development, whereas Python good. Python does allow inheritance from instances, unlike JavaScript. Head-to-head comparison between Python JavaScript Here, going discuss head-to-head comparison between Python JavaScript tabular form: Features Python JavaScript Strings default, source code Python ASCII unless define encoding format. JavaScript requires UTF-16 encoding, there built-in support manipulating bytes. Function Arguments function called with invalid parameters, Python will throw exception accept extra parameter passing syntax. Java-Script doesn't care functions aren't called with exact parameters because missing parameter treated "undefined" default, extra arguments treated special arguments. Properties Attributes getter setter functions define attribute Python using descriptor protocol. JavaScript objects have properties that made underlying attributes allow define property. REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) We'll when install Python, we'll different Python versions depending setup. Since Java-Script mainly used browsers, didn't have in-built REPL. However, REPL installing node.js. Numbers Python, various numeric types such int, fixed-point decimal, float, many others. contrast, Java-Script only supports floating-point numbers. Mutability Python both mutable immutable data types, including list. JavaScript data type like mutable immutable. Hash Tables built-in hash tables like dictionaries, collections, others that used store keys values hash. There built-in support hash tables. Data Types Python data types that similar each other that list tuple. Python's list JavaScript array very much similar each other. inbuilt array type. Modules Python refers itself battery-included language since comes with large number modules. JavaScript comes with just modules, including math, regexp, date, JSON. functionality available host environment, such browser another environment. Code Blocks uses indentation. uses curly brackets. Inheritance uses class-based inheritance model. uses prototype-based inheritance model. Scope Python better option math-intensive operations, data analytics, machine learning. JavaScript suitable developing website native app. Mobile Development reasonable option designing mobile apps. good choice mobile development addition front-end back-end development. Object Access Python's first argument each approach self-argument. JavaScript uses 'this' method accessing object. Conclusion Python JavaScript have minor differences. everything with both languages because they share many features such interpreted, functional, lexically scoped, object-oriented, imperative programming. Many libraries plugins available Python JavaScript more than what provided built-in functionality. While both have many opportunities, Python stronger market presence also easier learn.
