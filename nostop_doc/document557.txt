next prev 'and' Python following tutorial, will understand difference between 'and' Python programming language. Understanding difference between 'and' Python These some operators that utilize Python; however, there fundamental difference between two. 'and' operator used test whether both expressions utilized TRUE logical way). other hand, operator, when utilized with False/True values, tests whether both TRUE. Python programming language, empty built-in objects treated typically logically False. However, this case, non-empty built-in objects always logically True. Consequently, facilitates case usual utilization when user wants perform something when list empty wants perform something else when list empty. learn more about both operators discussed above. 'and' Operator Python: 'and' operator Logical that returns TRUE form whenever both operands also TRUE. Operator Python: operator bitwise operator utilized Python language. fundamentally acts different bits performs operations after bit. Note: Whenever integer value consider False. However, whenever utilize logically, consider True. because 'and' operator tests whether both these expressions True logical way) whereas operator performs different bitwise operations results acquired from both statements. consider some examples demonstrating these operators. Example examples demonstrating these operators. Example declaring variables printing result print(q p)	# first statement print(q p)		# second statement Output: Explanation: above snippet code, have declared variables performed operations using 'and' operators. result, there difference between operations' output. This happens because 'and' tests both expressions logically True, whereas performs bitwise operation output both statements. compiler checks first expression True first statement. first expression False, does test second expression returns False immediately. This process known "lazy evaluation". first expression True, then second expression tested, rules operations, True outcome only both statements True. above example, compiler tests first expression, True, value compiler moves towards second expression, which also True because value Hence, output also second statement, compiler performing bitwise operation outputs expressions. Here, statement getting evaluated follows: Binary value 0000 0110 Binary value 0001 0010 performing bitwise operation, will get: 0000 0110 &	=	0000 0010 (Binary value 0001 0010 Hence, output consider another example elaborate this. Example declaring variables printing results print(p first statement print(p second statement Output: Explanation: above snippet code, have declared variables printed results both operations. first statement performs bitwise operation both variables second statement evaluates statement inside print printing answer. first statement, 1011, 1100, Performing gives 1000, which binary value decimal value second statement, expression first evaluates False zero), value returned immediately because "lazy evaluation" explained above; else, evaluated. also non-zero, then resulting value returned. value returned because last value where check ends truthfulness statement. Thus, user Boolean 'and' recommended loop. Next TopicCryptography package Python prev next
