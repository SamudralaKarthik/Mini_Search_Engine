next prev Scratch Python Basics Learning text-based language's syntax difficult many learners. Syntax mistakes occur when certain rules violated program. Therefore, it's helpful highlight similarities contrasts between languages. Below some Scratch blocks their Python equivalents. list needs more thorough meant reference guide. Basics scratch python languages Here create, set, display basic variable values using both programming language's syntaxes. Variables Scratch Python Python, variable formed when assigned value, while Scratch, must created first. Python requires single double quotes around strings. Boost increment Variable Scratch lets change variable's value. Python lets change variable's value assigning itself adding subtracting number. Python Scratch output Scratch, make sprite talk output user. Python outputs shell with print statements. print strings Python, single double quotes. Python example above isn't easiest. while loop simplifies checking that variable smaller equal Comparison Scratch Python language following points show similarities differences between Scratch Python programming languages. Python Scratch infinite loops Scratch contains unlimited loops. Python uses always-True conditional loop. Selectivity (Conditional Selection) selection blocks available Scratch. Nested conditions needed many conditions. elif, else Python's selection statements. Again, colons indentation needed. Testing Equality Scratch's equal sign lets compare values. Python's single equal sign retained variable assignment. Hence double equal sign (==) utilized test equality. Lists Scratch Python Like variables, scratch lists created. Lists Python created with square brackets ([]) commas between items. list python scratch language. Both languages allow list removal. Scratch lists start Python lists start Python always counts from Randomness Scratch's random block generates numbers. Python needs random import operate code. Both languages pick random elements from list. Scratch Python Concatenation Scratch's join block joins strings. Python uses addition operation Join strings. Indexing Both languages item indexes find items lists strings. Input Scratch program asks block function collect user input. Python uses input() function programming. Python typecasting Scratch language recognizes strings integers. Python language requires typecasting when converting. example, convert strings integers vice versa. Appeal Complexity First things first: Python more complicated than Scratch. Both Scratch Python languages wonderful beginners (more this later), Python text-based better secondary students. Projects applications Project-based learning great ages; thus, both coding languages have potential. Scratch lets students make great games enhance their learning with hardware. Beginners will appreciate creating game sprite (character), visual learners integrate Scratch with VEX robotics. Python programming language's project potential greater. Project Length Python Scratch require different amounts labor results. Python "slow burn." Python coding great analytical students like logical problems topic evolution. Start basic with hardware insert visual hands-on learners. Scratch accelerates payout! language's bells whistles keep kids interested entertained. Conclusion Scratch Python both different programming languages development operations. Python Scratch have many differences also similarities functionality.
