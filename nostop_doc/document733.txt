next prev Python sleep() Function sleep() method pauses (waits) current thread's execution specified period time. Python contains time module that offers number helpful functions manage time-related tasks. Sleep common activities among them sleep() function pauses current thread's execution specified period time. Python time sleep function being used delay program's execution. stop running programme certain amount time seconds, sleep function Python. Keep mind that Python time sleep function only halts current thread's execution, entire programme. Python comes with built-in functionality sleeping programme. sleep() function time module allows pause caller thread's execution many seconds want. Code Python sleep() import time print("Printed time immediately.") time.sleep(2.5) print("Printed after seconds.") Output: "Printed time immediately" printed Suspends (Delays) execution seconds. "Printed after seconds" printed. aforementioned example demonstrates that sleep() accepts floating-point integer input. Prior Python 3.5, suspension time could actually shorter than value supplied argument time() method. suspension period least number seconds starting with Python 3.5. core developers Python made little adjustment time.sleep() behaves. Even though sleep stopped signal, newer Python sleep() system will continue least amount seconds we've chosen. However, message itself produces exception, then this does apply. Code Python Create Digital Clock import time while True: disttime time.disttime() time.strftime("%I:%M:%S %p", disttime) print(ans) time.sleep(1) Within endless while loop programme shown above, computed reported current local time. programme then waits full second. current local time once more calculated printed. This procedure continues. Output: 02:10:50 02:10:51 02:10:52 02:10:53 02:10:54 Code Improved Version Here significantly improved version previously mentioned software. import time while True: disttime time.disttime() time.strftime("%I:%M:%S %p", disttime) print(ans, end="", flush=True) print("\r", end="", flush=True) time.sleep(1) Output: 02:10:50 02:10:51 02:10:52 02:10:53 02:10:54 Multithreading Python: Let's speak about groups thread first before discussing sleep() multithreaded systems. There further instances which would want provide thread Python sleep() function. Maybe we're using production database containing millions documents migration script. choose threads because would want create downtime really want wait longer than required migration finished. Each instruction computer programme separate unit. carrying those directives constitutes procedure. part process called thread. even more threads present process. Code Python Multithreading tutorial programmes listed above single-threaded programmes. Here instance Python programme with several threads. import threading print_hola_3_times(): range(3): print("Hola") print_hey_3_times(): range(3): print("Hey") threading.Thread(target=print_hola_3_times) threading.Thread(target=print_hey_3_times) th1.start() th2.start() Output: Hola Hola Hola software mentioned above threads, th2. statements th1.start() th2.start() used start these threads. Keep mind that concurrently produce different results. time.sleep() Python Multithreaded Programs sleep() function pauses current thread's execution specified period time. Sleep() pauses operation thread processes single-threaded programmes. multithreaded programmes, function halts thread instead entire operation. Code sleep() Multithreaded Program import time from threading import Thread class make(Thread): run(self): xrange(0,11): print time.sleep(1) class made(Thread): run(self): xrange(100,103): print time.sleep(5) run(): make().start() made().start() Output: Next TopicDiabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning prev next
