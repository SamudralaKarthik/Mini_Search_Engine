next prev Python While Loops coding, loops designed execute specified code block repeatedly. We'll learn construct while loop Python, syntax while loop, loop controls like break continue, other exercises this tutorial. Introduction Python While Loop Python while loop iteration code block executed long given condition, i.e., conditional_expression, true. don't know many times we'll execute iteration ahead time, write indefinite loop. Syntax Python While Loop while conditional_expression: Code block while given condition, i.e., conditional_expression, evaluated initially Python while loop. Then, conditional expression gives boolean value True, while loop statements executed. conditional expression verified again when complete code block executed. This procedure repeatedly occurs until conditional expression returns boolean value False. statements Python while loop dictated indentation. code block begins when statement indented ends with very first unindented statement. non-zero number Python interpreted boolean True. False interpreted None Python While Loop Example Here will squares first natural numbers using while loop. Code Python program example show while loop initializing summation counter iteration summation while num: specifying condition loop begining code block summation c**2 summation incrementing counter print final print("The squares is", summation) Output: squares 1240 Provided that counter parameter gives boolean true condition, less than equal num, loop repeatedly executes code block number times. Next crucial point (which mostly forgotten). have increment counter parameter's value loop's statements. don't, while loop will execute itself indefinitely never-ending loop). Finally, print result using print statement. Exercises Python While Loop Prime Numbers Python While Loop Using while loop, will construct Python program verify given integer prime number not. Code [34, prime_number(number): condition iteration while iteration number number iteration condition break iteration iteration condition print(f"{number} PRIME number") else: print(f"{number} PRIME number") num: prime_number(i) Output: PRIME number PRIME number PRIME number PRIME number PRIME number PRIME number PRIME number Multiplication Table using While Loop this example, will while loop printing multiplication table given number. Code counter will while loop iterating times multiplication table print("The Multiplication Table num) while counter specifying condition counter print (num, 'x', counter, '=', ans) counter expression increment counter Output: Multiplication Table 189 Python While Loop with List will Python while loop square every number list Code Python program square every number list initializing list list_ squares programing while loop while list_: until list empty this expression will give boolean True after that False squares.append( (list_.pop())**2) print squares print( squares [36, preceding example, execute while loop over given list integers that will repeatedly long element list found. Python While Loop Multiple Conditions We'll need recruit logical operators combine more expressions specifying conditions into single while loop. This instructs Python collectively analyzing given expressions conditions. construct while loop with multiple conditions this example. have given conditions keyword, meaning until both conditions give boolean True, loop will execute statements. Code num1 num2 while num1 num2 multiple conditions single while loop num1 num2 print( (num1, num2) Output: (15, (13, (11, Let's look another example multiple conditions with operator. Code num1 num2 while num1 num2 num1 num2 print( (num1, num2) Output: (15, (13, (11, also group multiple logical expressions while loop, shown this example. Code num1 maximum_value counter while (counter num1 counter num2) counter maximum_value: grouping multiple conditions print(f"Number iterations: {counter}") counter Output: Number iterations: Number iterations: Number iterations: Number iterations: Single Statement While Loop Similar statement syntax, while clause consists statement, written same line while keyword. Here syntax example one-line while clause Python program show create single statement while loop counter while counter: print('Python While Loops') Loop Control Statements will discuss loop control statements detail. will example each control statement. Continue Statement returns control Python interpreter beginning loop. Code Python program show continue loop control Initiating loop string "While Loops": string string string "e": continue print('Current Letter:', string) Output: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Break Statement stops execution loop when break statement reached. Code Python program show break statement Initiating loop string "Python Loops": string 'n': break print('Current Letter: string) Output: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Pass Statement Pass statements used create empty loops. Pass statement also employed classes, functions, empty control statements. Code Python program show pass statement string "Python Loops": pass print( 'Last Letter:', string) Output: Last Letter: Next TopicPython break statement prev next
