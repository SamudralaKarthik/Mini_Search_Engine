next prev Python main() function this tutorial, will learn about main() function Python programming language. will also understand utilize __name__ attribute Python program order execute dynamically various contexts. begin with understanding what main() function Python Understanding main() function Python main() considered unique function several programming languages, also referred point execution program file. However, interpreter Python programming language executes each lines serial-wise from file explicit main() function. Python provides other conventions order define point execution. them utilizing main() function along with __name__ property python file. Now, understand __name__ property Python programming language. Understanding __name__ property Python __name__ property unique core variable Python that displays name present module. This property offers different values relying where Python file. consider example understand __name__ property better way. Executing Python File Script consider that have Python file known myworld.py containing following content: File: myworld.py print(__name__) Output: python myworld.py __main__ Explanation: above program file, have printed value __name__ property. result, value __name__ variable __main__. Executing Python File Module also execute Python file module. order perform this, need import required file into another Python program. consider following example understand concept properly. Suppose that have created Python file python_main.py same directory myworld.py file with following content: File: python_main.py import myworld Output: python python_main.py myworld Explanation: above program file, have imported module myworld. result, when executed python_main.py file, program runs complete code module file. However, observe that displays module name that myworld instead displaying __main__. This happens because, context executing Python file module, module name itself assigned __name__ variable. Using statement with __name__ variable Since have correctly understood __name__ property assigned values, utilize statement order same Python file differently various contexts. consider following example where have changed content myworld.py file. File: myworld.py main(): print("This Python program.") __name__ "__main__": main() Output: python myworld.py This Python program. Explanation: above snippet code, have defined function main() print some strings users. have then used conditional clause check value __name__ variable equal __main__, then main() function will execute. result, when executed myworld.py file, string message printed user. However, when execute file module importing python_main.py, program returns output main() function called. Thus, conclude custom main() function have defined myworld.py file only executed standalone script imported module. This standard method define main() function explicitly Python. among most popular cases __name__ property Python file. Next Topicstrftime() function Python prev next
