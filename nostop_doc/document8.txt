next prev Python Keywords Every scripting language designated words keywords, with particular definitions usage guidelines. Python exception. fundamental constituent elements Python program Python keywords. This tutorial will give basic overview Python keywords detailed discussion some important keywords that frequently used. Introducing Python Keywords Python keywords unique words reserved with defined meanings functions that only apply those functions. You'll never need import keyword into your program because they're permanently present. Python's built-in methods classes same keywords. Built-in methods classes constantly present; however, they limited their application keywords. Assigning particular meaning Python keywords means can't them other purposes code. You'll message SyntaxError attempt same. attempt assign anything built-in method type, will receive SyntaxError message; however, still smart idea. Python contains thirty-five keywords most recent version, i.e., Python 3.8. Here have shown complete list Python keywords reader's reference. False await else import pass None break except raise True class finally return continue lambda from nonlocal while assert global with async elif yield distinct versions Python, preceding keywords might changed. Some extras introduced, while others deleted. writing following statement into coding window, anytime retrieve collection keywords version working Code Python program demonstrate application iskeyword() importing keyword library which lists import keyword displaying complete list using "kwlist()." print("The keywords this version print( keyword.kwlist Output: keywords this version ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield'] calling help(), retrieve list currently offered keywords: Code help("keywords") Identify Python Keywords Python's keyword collection evolved versions were introduced. await async keywords, instance, were introduced till Python 3.7. Also, Python 2.7, words print exec constituted keywords; however, Python 3+, they were changed into built-in methods longer part keywords. paragraphs below, you'll discover numerous methods determining whether particular word Python keyword not. Write Code Syntax Highlighting There plenty excellent Python IDEs available. They'll highlight keywords them apart from rest terms code. This facility will assist immediately identifying Python keywords during coding that misuse them. Verify Keywords with Script REPL There several ways detect acceptable Python keywords plus know further regarding them Python REPL. Look SyntaxError Lastly, receive SyntaxError when attempting allocate name method with anything else with that, isn't permitted, it's probably keyword. This somewhat more difficult see, still technique Python tell you're misusing keyword. Python Keywords Their Usage following sections categorize Python keywords under headings based their frequency use. first category, instance, includes keywords utilized values, whereas next group includes keywords employed operators. These classifications will understanding keywords employed will assist arranging huge collection Python keywords. terms mentioned segment following unfamiliar you. They're explained here, must understand what they mean before moving Boolean assessment variable referred truthfulness. value's truthfulness reveals value variable true false. Boolean paradigm, truth refers variable that evaluates true. Pass item input bool() true. True returned, value item true. Strings lists which empty, non-zero numbers, many other objects illustrations true values. False refers item Boolean expression that returns false. Pass item input bool() false. False returned, value item false. Examples false values Value Keywords: True, False, None Three Python keywords employed values this example. These singular values, which reuse indefinitely every time correspond same entity. These values will most probably seen used frequently. Keywords True False These keywords typed lowercase conventional computer languages (true false); however, they typed uppercase Python every time. Python script, True Python keyword represents Boolean true state. False keyword equivalent True, except negative Boolean state false. True False those keywords that allocated variables parameters compared directly. Code print( print( print( True False print( print( print( True False Output: True False True True False False Because first, third, fourth statements true, interpreter gives True those False other statements. True False equivalent Python accompanying illustration support this claim: Code print( True print( False print( True True True) Output: False True None Keyword None Python keyword that means "nothing." None known nil, null, undefined different computer languages. function does have return clause, will give None default output: Code print( None print( None print( None False None None print( Output: False False False True no_return_function returns nothing, will simply return None value. None delivered functions that meet return expression program flow. Consider following scenario: Code no_return_function(): num1 num2 addition num1 num2 number no_return_function() print( number Output: None This program function with_return that performs multiple operations contains return expression. result, display number, None, which given default when there return statement. Here's example showing this: Code with_return( return False number with_return( print( number Output: None Operator Keywords: and, not, Several Python keywords employed operators perform mathematical operations. many other computer languages, these operators represented characters such and!. these keyword operations Python: Mathematical Operations Operations Other Languages Python Keyword AND, ∧ ∨ NOT, ¬ CONTAINS, IDENTITY Writers created Python programming with clarity mind. result, many operators other computer languages that employ characters Python English words called keywords. Keyword Python keyword determines whether both left-hand side right-hand side operands true false. outcome will True both components true. false, outcome will also False: Truth table True True True False True False True False False False False False <component1> <component2> It's worth noting that outcomes statement aren't always True False. and's peculiar behavior, this case. Instead processing inputs corresponding Boolean values, just gives <component1> false <component2> true. outputs expression could utilized with conditional clause provided bool() acquire obvious True False answer. Keyword keyword Python utilized check minimum, inputs true. first argument true, operation yields otherwise, second argument returned: <component1> <component2> Similarly keyword, keyword does change inputs corresponding Boolean values. Instead, outcomes determined based whether they true false. Truth table True True True True False True False True True False False False Keyword keyword Python utilized acquire variable's contrary Boolean value: keyword employed switch Boolean interpretation outcome conditional sentences other Boolean equations. Not, unlike and, determines specific Boolean state, True False, afterward returns inverse. Truth Table True False False True Code False True False True True Output: False True False Keyword keyword Python robust confinement checker, also known membership operator. provide element seek container series seek into, will give True False, depending that given element located given container: <an_element> <a_container> Testing certain character string nice illustration keyword: Code container "Javatpoint" print( container print( container Output: True False Lists, dictionaries, tuples, strings, data type with method __contains__(), iterate over will work with keyword. Keyword Python, it's used check identification objects. operation used determine whether arguments identical. also determines whether arguments relate unique object. When objects same, gives True; otherwise, gives False. Code print( True True print( False True print( None None print( Output: True False False True True, False, None same Python since there just version. Code print( print( print( print( Output: True False True False blank dictionary list same another blank one. However, they aren't identical entities because they stored independently memory. This because both list dictionary changeable. Code print( print( Output: True True Strings tuples, unlike lists dictionaries, unchangeable. result, equal strings tuples also identical. They're both referring unique memory region. nonlocal Keyword Nonlocal keyword usage fairly analogous global keyword usage. keyword nonlocal designed indicate that variable within function that inside function, i.e., nested function just local implying that located outer function. must define non-local parameter with nonlocal ever need change value under nested function. Otherwise, nested function creates local variable using that title. example below will assist clarifying this. Code the_outer_function(): the_inner_function(): nonlocal print("The value inside inner function: var) the_inner_function() print("The value inside outer function: var) the_outer_function() Output: value inside inner function: value inside outer function: the_inner_function() placed inside the_outer_function this case. the_outer_function variable named var. global variable, have noticed. result, wish change inside the_inner_function(), should declare using nonlocal. result, variable effectively updated within nested the_inner_function, evidenced results. following what happens don't nonlocal keyword: Code the_outer_function(): the_inner_function(): print("Value inside inner function: var) the_inner_function() print("Value inside outer function: var) the_outer_function() Output: Value inside inner function: Value inside outer function: Iteration Keywords: for, while, break, continue iterative process looping essential programming fundamentals. generate operate with loops, Python multiple keywords. These would utilized observed almost every Python program. Knowing them correctly assist becoming better Python developer. Keyword loop most popular loop Python. It's built blending Python keywords. They previously explained. while Keyword Python's while loop employs term while functions similarly other computer languages' while loops. block after while phrase will repeated repeatedly until condition following while keyword false. break Keyword want quickly break loop, employ break keyword. this keyword both while loops. continue Keyword continue Python keyword wish jump subsequent loop iteration. continue keyword, many other computer languages, enables quit performing present loop iteration subsequent one. Code Program show keywords for, while, break, continue range(15): print( breaking loop when break print() looping from initial condition while When value loop will jump next iteration using continue. will print continue else: when equal adding printing value print( Output: Exception Handling Keywords try, except, raise, finally, assert try: This keyword designed handle exceptions used conjunction with keyword except handle problems program. When there some kind error, program inside "try" block verified, code that block executed. except: previously stated, this operates conjunction with "try" handle exceptions. finally: Whatever outcome "try" section, "finally" implemented every time. raise: raise keyword could used specifically raise exception. assert: This method used help troubleshooting. Often used ensure that code correct. Nothing occurs expression interpreted true; however, false, "AssertionError" raised. output with error, followed comma, also printed. Code initializing numbers var1 var2 Exception raised section try: var1 var2 this will raise "divide zero" exception. print( this section will handle exception raised block except ZeroDivisionError: print("We cannot divide zero") finally: exception raised not, this block will executed every time print("This inside finally block") using assert keyword will check var2 print ("The value var1 var2 assert var2 "Divide error" print (var1 var2) Output: cannot divide zero This inside finally block value var1 var2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AssertionError Traceback (most recent call last) Input [44], using assert keyword will check var2 print ("The value var1 var2 ---> assert var2 "Divide error" print (var1 var2) AssertionError: Divide error pass Keyword Python, null sentence called pass. serves stand-in something else. When run, nothing occurs. Let's possess function that been coded however wish long term. write just this middle code, Code function_pass( arguments Output: function_pass( arguments IndentationError: expected indented block after function definition line shown, IndentationError will thrown. Rather, pass command create blank container. Code function_pass( arguments pass pass keyword create empty class too. Code class passed_class: pass return Keyword return expression used leave function generate result. None keyword returned default don't specifically return value. accompanying example demonstrates this. Code func_with_return(): return func_with_no_return(): print( func_with_return() print( func_with_no_return() Output: None Keyword keyword used remove reference object. Python, every entity object. command remove variable reference. Code var1 var2 var1 print( var2 print( var1 Output: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- NameError Traceback (most recent call last) Input [42], var1 print( var2 ----> print( var1 NameError: name 'var1' defined notice that variable var1's reference been removed. result, it's longer recognized. However, var2 still exists. Deleting entries from collection like list dictionary also possible with del: Code list_ ['A','B','C'] list_[2] print(list_) Output: ['A', 'B'] Next TopicPython Literals prev next
