next prev Indentation Error Python Before understanding indentation problem python, look brief about python programming language. What makes python different from other programming languages? Python interpreted, high-level object-oriented programming language along with having dynamic semantics. very simple syntax, very easy implement compared with other programming languages. Using python, programmers focus logic building rather than remembering syntax facing problem implement logic coding. dynamic smart high-level language most widely used among various users. compare python programming language syntax with other programming languages, like C++, Java, many more that have followed particular syntax. every block code, there opening closing braces. python, will follow proper rule indentation. Indentation refers proper participation white space while starting particular block code. much complicated more focused syntax. much faster efficient than other programming languages. Python code easily implemented easily written, easily executable. let's discuss concept indentation python. What indentation Python Programming Language? Indentation refers implementing proper spaces tabs starting statement, method block code python programming language. these indentations, easily identify beginning point endpoint conditional loop, functions, if-else statements Suppose observe other programming languages like C++, Java. that case, there small curly braces along with semicolon specifying particular block code identifying particular statement. here python, will concerned about using semicolon different braces syntax. There importance spaces Other programming languages compiler will ignore whitespace comments, lexical phase itself, starting phase; hence, cannot generate syntax errors. role whitespaces matters; block code starting applying white space, must same indent. statements must have same number whitespaces tabs that distance left screen belongs same block code. block more deeply nested, indented further right. Suppose observe python programming language. that case, there concept main function, compared with other programming languages. They have concept main function, which executed after then other functions. main function calls other function, pointer will point execute other functions again return main function. indentation, decided that initial indented block body main function. there other functions, then initial indented block will call that function. indentation additional function also different from main body that compiler distinguish block main derived function. Some basic Indentation Rules that used Python programming Language There proper indentation particular block code that must maintained while beginning ending code block. programmer split indentation into multiple lines using backslash. block where proper indentation maintained, python compile will throw indentation error. Being consistent following indentation rule quite confusing programmer code large contains lots lines code. indentation helps implement code using simple syntax, rather than applying brackets every block code, other programming languages. only easy also saves time reduces lines code; hence ultimately, speed increases execution tile reduces. number whitespace particular block code already fixed. nested conditional statements, then number whitespaces increased, according rule sub-sub statements. indentation errors Occur Python? writing certain code lines based some logic desired result, but, meanwhile, following above rules indentation. compiler will generate indentation error. understand with help example above figure, observe that mentioned python recognises every block code. will notice this figure, indentation every block calculation whitespaces from left corner statement began. Whenever particular block code starts, will follow indentation. first, will maintain proper whitespaces tabs, whenever block starts until ends. case inside that particular block includes nested block, will assign whitespaces till that nested block ends. this way, python programming language indentation block matches. indentation error occurs whenever there ending particular block, number whitespaces assigned starting code block same. same time that blocks ends, ultimately, indentation error occurs. Description above figure above figure, statement will executed. Then, pointer will point statement check condition; condition true, will enter block enter nested if-else block. Again nested statement, will check condition true, then executes next statement. this way, execution statements will carried now; take case where block fails, will enter into nested if-else block. directly exit form blocks final statement will execute, which matches with block initial block. figure having indentation error figure mentioned above clearly indentation error because block indentation does match starting ending point whitespaces. beginning block will contain whitespaces, while ends, contains whitespaces which will produce error. doubt arises that, block below block block nested block, then will generate indentation error, then answer this doubt because block nested block below block will have more whitespaces compare block After all, nested inside block second reason that python interpreter will find block will unable detect matching whitespaces from block hence will generate indentation error. indentation error python programming language? There points that must remember while fixing indentation error have seen earlier, indentation error occurs only unmatched whitespaces tabs; hence, need whitespaces tabs. Firstly need find error particular line code. After that, check number whitespaces that line detect block code which that line lies. Match indentation that block with ending starting point that block calculating number whitesces used starting ending that block. Still, error resolved, match indentation every block code with another corresponding block code using same calculating whitespaces tabs used Also, take help editor that using check number whitespaces tabs used, easily detect from finding unnecessary whitespaces used. Advantages Indentation Python Indentation used python represent certain block code, other programming languages, they refer various brackets. indentation, code looks more efficient beautifully structured. Indentation rules used python programming language very simple; even programmer wants their code readable. Also, indentation increases efficiency readability code structuring beautifully. Disadvantages Indentation Python uses whitespaces indentation, sometimes very tough task indentation error when there many lines code. various popular programming languages like C++, Java braces indentation, anybody coming from other side developed world finds hard adjust idea using whitespaces indentation.
