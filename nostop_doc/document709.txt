next prev What Sleeping Time Python? Have ever been forced delay execution Python programme? typically wish your code rapidly possible. There are, however, instances when serves your best interests your program sleep while. instance, mimic pause programme, Python's sleep() method. need wait while data uploads downloads; graphic loads shown screen. need take break even amid requests database operations. Each these situations many more benefit from inserting Python sleep() methods into code. Python time.sleep() Python time sleep method applied pause program's execution. employ sleep method time module Python programs stop execution programme certain amount time seconds. Remember that Python time sleep method halts current thread's execution, entire programme. Python time.sleep() Function Syntax sleep() function method time module. Therefore, before using this function, must first import time module into program. Following syntax using sleep function. import time time.sleep(t) sleep() method's input, time programme delayed which given seconds. That indicates that subsequent code line would after expression time.sleep(t) been executed after seconds execution previous code line. example below: Code Python program experience delayed execution sleep function importing required module import time printing time beginning execution print(time.ctime()) print("Before delay program") time.sleep(50) print("After delay program") printing time execution print(time.ctime()) Output: 17:07:33 2022 Before delay program After delay program 17:08:23 2022 second print statement executed after seconds when mentioned code invoked. Consequently, delays needed code. have more precise delay execution, also give parameter floating point number. instance, wish delay milliseconds 0.01 seconds), follows: Code Python program delay program milliseconds importing required module import time printing epoch time beginning execution print(time.time()) print("Before delay program") time.sleep(0.1) print("After delay program") printing epoch time execution print(time.time()) Output: 1661706874.95425 Before delay program After delay program 1661706875.0580375 Python time.sleep Example Let's look next Python time.sleep() function example. Code Python program sleep function inside Python loop Importing time module import time Time beginning execution program start time.ctime() print(start) range(10): using time.sleep() method halt execution time.sleep(5) print(i) time.ctime() print(end) Output: 17:19:50 2022 17:20:40 2022 loop's 5-second timeouts, total time spent greater than additional time result program's processing time, operating system thread sequencing, etc. Creating Delay Time Python List Code Python program create time delay Python list importing required package import time Marking beginning time time.ctime() print(b) creating delay seconds time.sleep(10) Initializing Python list my_List ["Time", "Sleep", "Python"] Printing list print(my_List) Marking program time.ctime() print(e) List will displayed after time difference seconds from beginning program Output: 12:28:05 2022 ['Time', 'Sleep', 'Python'] 12:28:15 2022 Creating Delay Time Python Tuple Code Python program create time delay Python tuple importing required package import time Recording beginning program time.ctime() print(b) creating delay seconds execution time.sleep(15) Initializing Python tuple my_tuple ("Time", "Sleep", "Python") Printing tuple print(my_tuple) Recording program time.ctime() print(e) Tuple will displayed after seconds delay execution Output: 12:32:31 2022 ('Time', 'Sleep', 'Python') 12:32:46 2022 Creating Delay Time Delay List Comprehension Code Python program create time delay list comprehension importing required package import time Displaying beginning execution time.ctime() print(b) creating Initializing list listt ['Delay', 'Time', 'Sleep', 'Python', 'Time', 'Module'] time delay seconds inserted between creating list comprehension printing components list listt [(time.sleep(10), print(l)) listt] Displaying execution time.ctime() print(e) Output: 12:38:03 2022 Delay Time Sleep Python Time Module 12:39:03 2022 Creating Many Time Delays Program Code Python program create time delay list comprehension importing required package import time Displaying start execution time.ctime() print(b) creating Initializing list languages ['Python', 'C', 'C++', 'R', 'Java', 'JavaScript', 'HTML'] Halting execution seconds here time.sleep(2) Interpreter will execute this command after seconds print(languages) languages: Halting execution seconds here time.sleep(5) component list will delayed after every seconds print(l) Displaying execution There must delay seconds complete execution program time.ctime() print(e) Output: 12:44:39 2022 ['Python', 'C', 'C++', 'R', 'Java', 'JavaScript', 'HTML'] Python Java JavaScript HTML 12:45:16 2022 Python Thread Sleep sleep() method Python crucial multithreading technique. straightforward example demonstrates Python time sleep method merely halts operation currently running thread multithreaded coding. Code Python program show sleep() function thread Importing required modules import time from threading import Thread Beginning thread class a_thread(Thread): func(self): range(10): print(i) time.sleep(5) class Delay(Thread): func(self): range(100, 105): print(i) time.sleep(10) print("Starting thread a_thread") a_thread().start() print("Starting delay thread") Delay().start() print("Complete") Including Python time.sleep() Request With Decorators occasionally required failed operation again. This frequent scenario when have repeat file downloading since server overloaded. Including Python sleep() function between every request preferable because usually won't like send requests server frequently. I've also monitor status while running automated test, another scenario. user interface load quicker slower than expected based machine using test, which could alter information displayed screen when software checking anything. this situation, instruct application take little break verify everything again moment later. This determine whether test passed failed. either these scenarios, Python sleep() method using decorator. Let's examine illustration: Code import time sleep(timeout, retry real_decorator(function): a_wrapper(*args, **kwargs): retry_no while retry_no retry: try: function(*args, **kwargs) None: return except: print(f'This sleeping {timeout} seconds') time.sleep(timeout) retry_no return a_wrapper return real_decorator This decorator above code: sleep(). receives time window retry count, with default setting three. real decorator(), function that takes decorated method, contained within sleep() method. Last least, inner method wrapper() takes both keyword arguments parameters passed decorated method. magic happens right here! invoking procedure once more using while loop. there exception raised, should declare over. executing function once more after using sleep() increasing number retries.
