next prev Conditional Expressions Python Python's conditional statements carry various calculations operations according whether particular Boolean condition evaluated true false. Python, IF statements deal with conditional statements. We'll learn conditional statements Python this tutorial. What Python Statement? make decisions, utilize statement Python. body instructions that only executes whenever statement's condition met. additional else statement, which includes some instructions else statement, runs condition false. Python's if-else statement used when wish satisfy statement while other false. Python Syntax Statement: <conditional expression> Statement else Statement Code Python program execute statement Initializing condition code greater than print(code) Output: greater than else Condition? "else condition" usually used when judging statement based another. condition mentioned code block wrong, then interpreter will execute else code block. Code Python program execute if-else statement Initializing if-else condition code less than print(code) else: print("a greater than Output: greater than When else Statement does Work There could situations where your "otherwise condition" doesn't produce desired outcome. flaw program's logic, will print incorrect result. This typically occurs when there more than statements conditions program. illustration will make this notion easier grasp. Since both variables, this case, identical program's output that greater than FALSE. This because evaluates first condition, expression Python, then prints next condition (the else statement) default first condition fails. following step will examine this mistake. Code Python program when else condition does work Initializing if-else condition code less than else: code greater than print(code) Output: greater than elif Condition? employ "elif" clause issue caused "else condition" made earlier. instruct software print third condition alternative when first conditions fail erroneous using "elif" condition. Code Python program show elif condition Initializing if-else condition code less than elif code equal else: code greater than print(code) Output: equal Python Nested Statement following example demonstrates nested Statement Python Code Python program show nested if-else conditions Initializing if-else conditions print("B largest number") else: print("A largest number") elif print("C largest number") else: print("All numbers equal") print("C common factor Output: largest number Next TopicHow Print List Without Brackets Python prev next
