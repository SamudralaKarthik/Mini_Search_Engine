next prev Started with RabbitMQ Python this tutorial, will learn about RabbitMQ implement using Python. This tutorial will also give brief knowledge message queue defines essential concepts. will understand basic functionalities RabbitMQ, message queue, exchanges, many others. Before diving deep into this tutorial, let's have basic understanding RabbitMQ. What RabbitMQ? RabbitMQ popular message brokers used transmit messages from end. Messages transmit information. message contain kind information, could have information about process task. message broker works post office; when want some message, information letter keep post box, sure that letter carrier will eventually deliver them recipient. RabbitMQ uses some terms such Producer nothing generating message transfer. other words, procedure program that sends message consumer sends message known producing. Queue queue post office that lives inside RabbitMQ. message flow stored inside queue. queue only bounded host's memory disk limits. essentially large message buffer. queue message from sender, many consumers receive data from queue. Consumer program that waits receive messages consuming similar receiving. Note producer, consumer, broker have reside same host. Most applications don't have, application both procedure consumer. RabbitMQ Example message broker works bridge between various services (for example applications). They play essential role reducing load delivery times application servers delegating tasks that would typically take time resources third party with other job. take real-world example application that takes uploaded information user. website uses this information generate email back user. create pdf, application will take several seconds. Hence, role message queue emerges. queue will used perform task. Every time users upload their information into interface, application will create "PDF processing" message consisting essential information user needs into message placed onto queue defined RabbitMQ. above diagram basic diagram message queue there application known producers that creates message transmit them broker (the message queue). second application consumer, connect queue subscribe message processed. Software worked procedure, consumer, both consumer producer messages. Messages stored queue until consumer retrieves them. When should RabbitMQ Message queuing allows servers respond quickly instead being forced perform resource-heavy procedure spot that delays response time. message queue plays essential role want distribute message multiple consumers balance loads between workers. consumer takes message queue starts processing PDF. same time, producer queuing messages. There also interesting fact, consumer reside different server than producer, they reside same server. request created programming language handled another programming language. point that applications will only communicate through messages they send each other, which means sender receiver have coupling. What Exchanges? discussed earlier, messages stored queue; they stored directly. procedure sends message exchange, exchange responsible routing message different queues with help bindings routing keys. binding responsible exchange. Message flow RabbitMQ Let's understand flow messages RabbitMQ. producer produces message publishes exchange. When creating exchange, type must specified. This topic will covered later exchange takes message ready route message. exchange takes different message attributes into account, such routing key, depending exchange type. Bindings must created from exchange queues. this case, there different queues from exchange. exchange routes message into queues depending message attributes. queue holds messages until customer consumes them. consumer handles message. Types Exchanges Below essential exchanges. Direct message routed queues whose binding matches message's routing key. Fanout fanout exchange transmits messages queues bound Topic exchange matches routing routing pattern specified binding. Headers Headers transmits message header attributes routing. Installation RabbitMQ will install RabbitMQ window which straightforward process. Before installing RabbitMQ, must have Erlang virtual machine, already Erlang installed then directly install RabbitMQ. Install Erlang Windows Click official website download 22.0. Then click above highlighted 22.0 windows xx-bit Binary file; will around 94+ size. Once download otp_win64_22.0 file then would below setup window. Select Erlang checkbox click Next button. Then choose destination folder install Erlang click Next button. will show start menu, select click install button. Erlang installation will start; will take while complete. click close button, have successfully installed. Enable RabbitMQ Management Plugins RabbitMQ runs default window services; much interested working with command line tool, depends download RabbitMQ server.exe show below image. Double click download rabbitmq-server-3.8.1.exe click Next. Follow above process, click Finish installation will complete. Implement RabbitMQ with Python Now, will learn implement RabbitMQ with Python. First, create send.py file which will send message queue. work with RabbitMQ need install pika module system. install pika, type following command terminal. install pika This command will install pika local machine. ready work with RabbitMQ. import pika connection pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost')) channel connection.channel() above code, import pika module establish connection with broker local machine -hence local. need specify name address connect different devices. next step configuring queue, need ensure recipient queue exists. send message non-existing location, RabbitMQ will drop message. will create my_queue, which message will deliver. channel.queue_declare(queue='my_queue') ready transmit message. will send string "Hello World" my_queue. discussed earlier, cannot deliver message queue directly. always needs through exchange. empty string defines default exchange. This exchange special allows specify exactly which queue message need specify queue name routing_key parameter. channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='hello', body='Hello World!') print(" 'Hello World Delievered!'") close connection using below command. connection.close() Receiving will create second program receive.py message from queue print screen. Again, need establish connection with RabbitMQ server. will previous code. also need check queue exists check above code. channel.queue_declare(queue='my_queue') here question arise, would need declare queue again have already declared previous code. could avoid that were sure that queue already exists. Let's take scenario send.py file before. sure which program first. good declaring queue both programs. Receiving message from queue more complex. works subscribing callback function queue. callback function called pika library every received message. program, function will print screen contents message. callback(ch, method, properties, body): print(" Received body) need inform RabbitMQ that this particular callback function should receive message from my_queue. channel.basic_consume(queue='hello', auto_ack=True, on_message_callback=callback) Fortunately, have repeated about queue declaration don't need worry about queue existing related errors. auto_ack parameter will described later_on. There scenario where enter endless loop waits data runs callbacks whenever necessary. such case, will handle keyboardInterrupt error. print(' [*] Waiting messages. exit press CTRL+C') channel.start_consuming() Let's below code snippet. __name__ '__main__': try: main() except KeyboardInterrupt: print('Interrupted') try: sys.exit(0) except SystemExit: os._exit(0) time code place more understanding. send.py import pika connection pika.BlockingConnection( pika.ConnectionParameters(host='localhost')) channel connection.channel() channel.queue_declare(queue='hello') channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='hello', body='Hello World!') print("'Hello World!'") connection.close() Receive.py import pika, sys, main(): connection pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host='localhost')) channel connection.channel() channel.queue_declare(queue='hello') callback(ch, method, properties, body): print(" Received body) channel.basic_consume(queue='hello', on_message_callback=callback, auto_ack=True) print('Waiting messages. exit press CTRL+C') channel.start_consuming() __name__ '__main__': try: main() except KeyboardInterrupt: print('Interrupted') try: sys.exit(0) except SystemExit: os._exit(0) above script terminal. First, let's start consumer which will continuously waiting message deliveries. python receive.py Output: Waiting messages. exit press CTRL start procedure terminal. procedure program will stop after every run. consumer will print Waiting messages. exit press CTRL+C Received 'Hello World!' Congratulations, send first message through RabbitMQ successfully. this tutorial, have learned send receive message from named queue. Conclusion This tutorial included guide implementing RabbitMQ with Python programming language. Apart from that, have also discussed introduction RabbitMQ Following this guide, will know about basic functionality flow. Rest follow official documentation more insights into RabbitMQ. documentation well-written with appropriate example. Next TopicHow Send Push Notification Python prev next
