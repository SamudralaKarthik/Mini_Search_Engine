next prev Fizz-Buzz Program Python Fizz-Buzz programming task used explaining division numbers Fizz, Buzz, Fizz_Buzz group. Suppose user number 'n,' they have display string representation numbers from there some limitations such Suppose number dividable then will print "Fizz" place number. number dividable will print "Buzz" place number result. suppose given number dividable both will print "Fizz_Buzz" place number. number neither dividable will print number string. solving above problem considering limitations, have follow below steps: program, have apply condition numbers from 'n.' Example: class Example(object): Fizz_Buzz(self, :type :rtype: List[str] result range(1 n+1): result.append(" Fizz_Buzz elif result.append(" Fizz elif result.append(" Buzz else: result.append(str(i)) return Result object1 Example() print(object1.Fizz_Buzz(55)) Output: ['1', '2', Fizz '4', Buzz Fizz '7', '8', Fizz Buzz '11', Fizz '13', '14', Fizz_Buzz '16', '17', Fizz '19', Buzz Fizz '22', '23', Fizz Buzz '26', Fizz '28', '29', Fizz_Buzz '31', '32', Fizz '34', Buzz Fizz '37', '38', Fizz Buzz also write above program using loop method. Example: range(35): Numbers which divisible that means divisible both will print "Fizz_Buzz" place number print(" Fizz_Buzz continue Numbers which dividable will print "Fizz" place number elif print(" Fizz") continue Numbers which dividable will print "Buzz" place number elif print(" Buzz continue result will Print numbers print(num) Output: 	Fizz_Buzz Fizz Buzz Fizz Fizz Buzz Fizz Fizz_Buzz Fizz Buzz Fizz Fizz Buzz Fizz Fizz_Buzz Fizz Summary this article, have discussed user write python program Fizz Buzz problem, have also discussed some limitations that must followed.
