next prev Python Closure language like Python abundant concepts that interesting meant ease work programmers. this tutorial, will learn about python closures. before that revise nested functions they pre-requisite understand this topic. let's started: Program program given below illustrates concept nested functions local variables. #outer function function_1(txt): #inner function function_2(): print(txt) function_2() function_1('Python JavaTpoint') Output: Python JavaTpoint Explanation: understand what have done this program- have created function_1 that takes parameter inside this, have made another function that prints value txt. 'function_2' called above program then have passed string value function_1. executing this program, displays desired output. Program Now, let's closure help making work simpler enhancing program. following program illustrates same- #outer function function_1(txt): #inner function function_2(): print(txt) return function_2() function_3=function_1('Let learn programming language.') function_3() Output: learn programming language. Explanation: understand what have done this program- have created function_1 that takes parameter inside this, have made another function that prints value txt. value 'function_2' returned above program then have passed string value function_1 allotted that function_3. executing this program, displays desired output. Observation: Based above observation, conclude that- With help closure, invoke functions that outside scope Python. that closure function object that remembers values present enclosed scope. record which each variable function mapped with value reference name when closure created. acts fetch access variables with help closure copies. When Closure closure following conditions: program must have nested function. function should refer value enclosed function. enclosing function should return nested function. Some More Features- Features Closures are: Closures provide kind data hiding program avoid using global variables. efficient option when don't have many functions program. Program Finally, let's have look more interesting program that uses closure. program shows situation when closure instead class. add_num(n): addition(x): return return addition add_2=add_num(2) add_8=add_num(8) print(add_2(4)) print(add_2(8)) print(add_8(add_2(7))) Output: Explanation: understand what have done above program- function that created add_num inside this, there another function called addition. This function supposed return value. next statements, have used different ways adding numbers. executing program, displays required result. Conclusion this tutorial, learned what closures when them make program more effective. Next TopicPython Glob Module prev next
