next Python Pandas Tutorial Python Pandas defined open-source library that provides high-performance data manipulation Python. This tutorial designed both beginners professionals. used data analysis Python developed McKinney 2008. Tutorial provides basic advanced concepts Python Pandas, such Numpy, Data operation Time Series Python Pandas Introduction Pandas defined open-source library that provides high-performance data manipulation Python. name Pandas derived from word Panel Data, which means Econometrics from Multidimensional data. used data analysis Python developed McKinney 2008. Data analysis requires lots processing, such restructuring, cleaning merging, etc. There different tools available fast data processing, such Numpy, Scipy, Cython, Panda. prefer Pandas because working with Pandas fast, simple more expressive than other tools. Pandas built Numpy package, means Numpy required operating Pandas. Before Pandas, Python capable data preparation, only provided limited support data analysis. Pandas came into picture enhanced capabilities data analysis. perform five significant steps required processing analysis data irrespective origin data, i.e., load, manipulate, prepare, model, analyze. Features Pandas fast efficient DataFrame object with default customized indexing. Used reshaping pivoting data sets. Group data aggregations transformations. used data alignment integration missing data. Provide functionality Time Series. Process variety data sets different formats like matrix data, tabular heterogeneous, time series. Handle multiple operations data sets such subsetting, slicing, filtering, groupBy, re-ordering, re-shaping. integrates with other libraries such SciPy, scikit-learn. Provides fast performance, want speed even more, Cython. Benefits Pandas benefits pandas over using other language follows: Data Representation: represents data form that suited data analysis through DataFrame Series. Clear code: clear Pandas allows focus core part code. provides clear concise code user. Python Pandas Data Structure Pandas provides data structures processing data, i.e., Series DataFrame, which discussed below: Series defined one-dimensional array that capable storing various data types. labels series called index. easily convert list, tuple, dictionary into series using "series' method. Series cannot contain multiple columns. parameter: Data: list, dictionary, scalar value. Creating Series from Array: Before creating Series, Firstly, have import numpy module then array() function program. import pandas import numpy info np.array(['P','a','n','d','a','s']) pd.Series(info) print(a) Output dtype: object Explanation: this code, firstly, have imported pandas numpy library with alias. Then, have taken variable named "info" that consist array some values. have called info variable through Series method defined variable. Series printed calling print(a) method. Python Pandas DataFrame widely used data structure pandas works with two-dimensional array with labeled axes (rows columns). DataFrame defined standard store data different indexes, i.e., index column index. consists following properties: columns heterogeneous types like int, bool, seen dictionary Series structure where both rows columns indexed. denoted "columns" case columns "index" case rows. Create DataFrame using List: easily create DataFrame Pandas using list. import pandas list strings ['Python', 'Pandas'] Calling DataFrame constructor list pd.DataFrame(x) print(df) Output Python Pandas Explanation: this code, have defined variable named that consist string values. DataFrame constructor being called list print values. Prerequisite Before learning Python Pandas, should have basic understanding Computer Programming terminologies programming languages.
