This classic game gained much popularity that some tips, tricks, strategies utilized win, just like most games. This classic game gained much popularity that some tips, tricks, strategies utilized win, just like most games. Understanding rules Game Before start deploying this Game into code-based solution, must understand rules around does this game work? Then efficiently translate this Game into snippet code. Game Rules: Rule individual sets word list words. Rule player takes initial guess letter that might start contained word list words. Rule letter present word/list words, player gains point takes another turn guessing letter. Rule letter present word, player losses attempt(s)/point, part hangman appears. Rule hangman appears after every wrongly guessed letter until entire image drawn. Rule Similarly, every correctly guessed letter, letters placed screen until word completed player wins. understand stepwise implementation Hangman game Python. Implementation Hangman Python concept using this project quite simple. creating physical on-screen drawings Python, this version Hangman game will count down many lives have remained. understand implementation with help steps described below: STEP Importing random module STEP Defining function welcome user/player. STEP Creating variable user's/player's name within this function using string method capture user's name sentence case. STEP Creating decision-making process check that user only enters alphabets numbers name. consider following snippet code demonstrating implementation above steps. File: hangmanGame.py importing random module import random defining greetings() function greetings(): defining username variable username input(""" ================================================== Welcome Hangman Game! Enter your name: """).capitalize() using decision making process accept only alphabets name username.isalpha() True: print(""" Hello,""", username """!""", """We glad have here! will playing against computer today. computer will randomly choose word will guess correct word always invite friends time together ================================================================== Good Luck! Have playing """) else: print('Please enter valid name using alphabets only') username input('Enter game name here: print('Hello, username Please through rules game below:') Explanation: above snippet code, have imported random module. have then defined greetings() function. have defined variable username that accepts string input from user containing their name within this function. have then used if-else conditional statement accept only alphabets name. STEP Defining another function "playAgain()". STEP Adding decision-making process. consider following snippet code demonstrating implementation these above steps. File: hangmanGame.py defining playAgain() function playAgain(): This function asks user/player they wish replay hangman game userResponse input('Would like play again? N').lower() creating decision making process userResponse 'y': gameRun() else: print('Hope playing this game. next time!') Explanation: above snippet code, have defined function playAgain(). have asked user they want play again within this function stored their answer userResponse variable. have then used if-else conditional statement create decision-making process. STEP Defining another function, "getWord()", generating random words user guess. consider following snippet code demonstrating implementation above step. File: hangman.py defining getWord() function getWord(): This function produces word user will attempt guessing listOfWords ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Papaya', 'Mango', 'Kiwi', 'Orange', 'Pineapple', 'Grapes', 'Cherry', 'Watermelon'] return random.choice(listOfWords).lower() Explanation: above snippet code, have defined function getWord(). Within this function, have defined list consisting some words. then used random module select random word from list returned STEP Defining another function "gameRun()". STEP Calling greetings() function inside gameRun() function order commence game. STEP Defining 'alphabet' variable within function. STEP Setting 'randomWord' variable (for guessed word) getWord() function random word chosen. STEP Initiating empty list guessed letter. STEP Initiating 'attempts' variable store value number attempts made user. STEP Setting initial guess 'False'. STEP Printing empty line. STEP Printing guess hint user number letters contained word. consider following snippet code demonstrating implementation steps File: hangmanGame.py defining gameRun() function gameRun(): calling greeting() function greetings() defining 'alphabet' variable alphabet ('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz') getting random word from getWord() function randomWord getWord() initiating empty list guessed letter guessedLetters initiating 'attempts' variable number attempts user attempts setting initial guess False guess False empty line print() printing guess hint user number letters consisted word print('The Word consists of', len(randomWord), 'letters.') print(len(randomWord) '_') Explanation: above snippet code, have defined function gameRun(). have called greetings() function within this function. have then defined variable alphabet. called getWord() function stored returned value variable randomWord. have then initiated empty list guessed letters variable total number attempts. have then initial value guess False. last, have printed guess hint user number letters contained word. STEP Initiating while loop within gameRun() function creating decisions, taking into consideration player decides input just single letter full word. STEP Also, creating decisions check input value user wrong user inputs letters equal total number letters word guess. STEP Deducting attempts each time user fails guess correctly. STEP Initiating playAgain() function player wishes continue gameRun() function. consider following snippet code demonstrating implementation these above steps File: hangmanGame.py while guess False attempts print('You have str(attempts) attempts') userGuess input('Guess letter word enter full word: ').lower() user inputs letter len(userGuess) userGuess alphabet: print('You enter letter. Consider checking your entry make sure enter alphabet number.') elif userGuess guessedLetters: print('You have already guessed that letter before. again!') elif userGuess randomWord: print('Oops! that letter part word.') guessedLetters.append(userGuess) attempts elif userGuess randomWord: print('Awesome! This letter present word!') guessedLetters.append(userGuess) else: print('Invalid Input! might have entered wrong entry.') user inputs full word elif len(userGuess) len(randomWord): userGuess randomWord: print('Awesome! guessed word correctly!') guess True else: print('Oops! that word were looking for.') attempts user inputs letter equal total number letters word guess else: print('The length guess same length word.') attempts the_status guess False: letter randomWord: letter guessedLetters: the_status letter else: the_status print(the_status) the_status randomWord: print('Awesome! guessed word correctly!') guess True elif attempts print('Unfortunately! guesses couldn\'t guessed word.') initiating playAgain() function user wishes continue playAgain() Explanation: above snippet code, have used while loop. Within this loop, have used if-elif-else conditional statements check whether guess input player single letter full word. have also checked whether value input player wrong not. have also checked input letter user equal total number letters word guess. have then deducted attempts each time user fails guess correctly. last, have initiated playAgain() function player would like continue gameRun() function. STEP Calling gameRun() function execute program. consider following snippet code demonstrating implementation above step. File: hangmanGame.py executing program gameRun() Explanation: above snippet code, have called gameRun() function order execute program. coding 'Hangman Game' program finally completed. save file program working. order program, type following command command-line shell terminal: Command: python hangmanGame.py before output, here complete project code. Complete Project Code following program file complete code 'Hangman Game' project.
