next prev Web2py Framework Python following tutorial, will understand Web2py framework Python programming language. Understanding Web2py Framework Web2py easy-to-use framework that does require installation configuration. This framework portable also executed drive. based framework like many other Python frameworks. Though most them support older versions Python programming language, Web2py framework still supports versions like Python 2.7. also supports LDAP authentication, which widely accepted these days. Web2py framework attempts lower barrier entry development focusing three chief goals: Rapid Development Ease Security Acknowledging perspective user, Web2py framework developed constantly being optimized internally order make faster leaner framework with inclusion support backward compatibility. Setting Environment Execution Web2py framework easy, need download .exe file from following link: http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download Windows, download file, unzip execute .exe file either directly from command line. will prompted with screen asking admin password shown below: choose administrator password start server. will following screen: Creating application using Web2py create application with help Python Web2py framework. will start clicking admin table located bottom. after entering admin password, will have following screen: Now, simple application, enter some application name (for example, introWeb2py) click create. This will display design interface page shown below: also current live web, introWeb2py, simply type http://127.0.0.1:8000/introWeb2py local machine, will output shown below: design page introWeb2py application, will controller click edit button next default.py. alter return value index() function, following output will displayed. File: default.py ---- example index page ---- index(): response.flash T("Hello World") return "Hello Guys, Welcome Javatpoint.com. This web2py application. This framework easy works effortlessly. Thank you!" Now, save changes. check changes made introWeb2py application refreshing http://127.0.0.1:8000/introWeb2py link. output same shown below: Output: Deployment application Cloud platform want deploy application Cloud platform, will back home page click site. select option deployment. Here, will select "pythonAnywhere". will then pythonAnywhere website register ourselves done already). will then click "Add app" fill credentials (Select web2py app). That's will https://username.pythonanywhere.com/welcome/default/index, click admin (enter password). Next, will click upload install packed application. have fill credentials below click install. Once everything completed, pop-up message will appear. order view application, open below link: https://username.pythonanywhere.com/welcome/default/index following screen. Output: Hence, first web2py application created deployed successfully. last, conclude Web2py framework free, fast, secure development framework that entirely written Python programming language encourages with help Python every possible (model, view, controller). very good framework small applications prototypes; however, fails fulfill enterprise-class quality requirements. enterprise-level application, complexity solving bugs will increase exponentially lack unit tests, good accurate error reporting, scattered models.
