Now, functions Emoji Module importing into Python program print emojis output. Emoji Module: Implementation With help Emoji Module, cannot just implement emojis Python also convert emojis passed into short names. have following different functions Emoji Module these different tasks: emojize() function demojize() function Now, will learn about both these functions given above each them inside Python program better understand their implementation functioning. emojize() function: While using emojize() function Python program, have pass CLDR short names emoji parameter, then this function will convert CLDR short names into emoji. resultant emoji/s produced emojize() function will printed program's output. Example will emojize() function with short CLDR names Emojis following example program print emojis: Import Emoji Module import emoji print("Following emojis small digital images different expressions printed Python: Print different type Emojis print("Emoji with grinning faces: emoji.emojize(":grinning_face_with_big_eyes:")) print(emoji.emojize(":grinning_squinting_face:")) print(emoji.emojize(":grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:")) print(emoji.emojize(":grinning_face_with_sweat:")) print("Emoji with beaming face: emoji.emojize(":beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:")) More popular Emojis print("More Emoji with popular faces: print(emoji.emojize(":grinning_face:")) print(emoji.emojize(":upside-down_face:")) print(emoji.emojize(":zany_face:")) print(emoji.emojize(":shushing_face:")) Output: Following emojis small digital images different expressions printed Python: Emoji with grinning faces: Emoji with beaming face: More Emoji with popular faces: Explanation: have first imported Emoji Module into program that emojize() module print modules. Then, used emojize() module inside print statement printed multiple emojis with this function passing CLDR short names emojis argument inside function. have used CLDR short names multiple emojis print multiple emojis with different expressions output. output, multiple emojis with different expressions have been printed according CLDR short name argument have passed inside emojize() function. Note: Now, many wondering that will these CLDR short names emojis that print emojis Python with their help. want CLDR names emojis, refer official website Unicode CLDR names, convenience, providing here CLDR names some famous emojis. Following CLDR short names some famous emojis: CLDR short name Emoji beaming face with smiling eyes grinning face face with tears smiling face with halo face blowing kiss kissing face with smiling eyes zany face face with hand over mouth face with raised eyebrow smirking face lying face drooling face nauseated face grinning face with eyes grinning face with sweat upside-down face smiling face with hearts kissing face face savouring food squinting face with tongue want these emojis look like, these CLDR short names argument inside emojize() function, corresponding emoji with that CLDR short name will printed output. demojize function: When given emoji want find CLDR short name, demojize function this. have pass emoji argument inside demojize() function, CLDR short name will printed output, that's will find short name using demojize function. Example Printing CLDR short names emoji using emoji argument inside demojize function Python program: Import Emoji Module import emoji Printing CLDR short names Emojis print("CLDR short names various emojis:") print(emoji.demojize('?')) print(emoji.demojize('?')) print(emoji.demojize('?')) print(emoji.demojize('?')) print(emoji.demojize('?')) print(emoji.demojize('?')) print(emoji.demojize('?')) print(emoji.demojize('?')) print(emoji.demojize('?') Output: CLDR short names various emojis: :shushing_face: :zany_face: :upside-down_face: :grinning_face: :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: :grinning_face_with_sweat: :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: :grinning_squinting_face: :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: see, CLDR short name emojis that have used demojize() function program printed output once program executed.
