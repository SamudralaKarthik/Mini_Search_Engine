next prev Typecasting Python this tutorial, will learn typecasting happens Python. come across different kinds arithmetic operations which multiple data types involved then results obtained accordingly. Here will discuss both, Implicit type conversion Explicit type conversion Let's understand them with help programs- Implicit Type Conversion During implicit type conversion, user supposed mention specific data type during conversion. following program illustrates done Python. #program demonstrate implicit type conversion #initializing value print(a) print("The type type(a)) #initializing value print(b) print("The type type(b)) #initializing value print(c) print("The type type(c)) #initializing value print(d) print("The type type(d)) #performing arithmetic operations print("The product res) print("The addition add) Output: type <class 'int'> type <class 'float'> type <class 'float'> type <class 'float'> product 45.0 addition Explanation- Let's have glance explanation this program. check values converted performing operations have initialized values a,b, After this, have checked data type each them. Finally, have performed addition variables multiplication variables executing above program, observe that case product final result float value(a integer float). Now, it's time move next thing which explicit type conversion. Explicit Type Conversion this type conversion, user supposed pass value function obtain required data type. int(), float() str() mostly used explicit type conversion. Consider program given below, #program demonstrate explicit type conversion #initializing value a=10.6 print("The type before typecasting ",type(a)) print(int(a)) print("The type after typecasting is",type(a)) #initializing value b=8.3 print("The type before typecasting ",type(b)) print(int(b)) print("The type after typecasting is",type(b)) #initializing value c=7 print("The type before typecasting ",type(c)) print(float(c)) print("The type after typecasting is",type(c)) Output: type before typecasting <class 'float'> type after typecasting <class 'float'> type before typecasting <class 'float'> type after typecasting <class 'float'> type before typecasting <class 'int'> type after typecasting <class 'int'> Explanation- Let's understand what have done this program. have initialized values have used int() float() this program does explicit type conversion takes place. executing this program, verify data type changes. Finally, have look last program this article that covers possible types explicit type conversions. #program demonstrate explicit type conversion #initializing value a=10 print("The type before typecasting ",type(a)) print(str(a)) print("The type after typecasting is",type(a)) #initializing value b='8' print("The type before typecasting ",type(b)) print(int(b)) print("The type after typecasting is",type(b)) #initializing value c='7.9' print("The type before typecasting ",type(c)) print(float(c)) print("The type after typecasting is",type(c)) Output: type before typecasting <class 'int'> type after typecasting <class 'int'> type before typecasting <class 'str'> type after typecasting <class 'str'> type before typecasting <class 'str'> 7.9 type after typecasting <class 'str'> Explanation- approach similar above program this program, have included conversion using three int(), str(), float(). Conclusion this tutorial, learned what typecasting python, what types, performed Python. Next TopicDateutil module Python prev next
