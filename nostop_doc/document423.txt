next prev TypeError string indices must integer What TypeError python? TypeError exceptions python programming language. This exception occurs when operation performed unsupported object type valid object type. raised occurs whenever there exception. Also, name suggests, this type error arises whenever there wrong object, perform unrelated operation There mainly three types errors Python programming language: syntax error, logical error, exception. This type error lies category exception error. user easily handle type error using raise keyword. TypeError: string indices must integer know, basic structure string consists index values. starting value string begins with index value will continue till length given string. TypeError arises whenever want fetch particular character string with specified index value. Still, instead entering integer value index, will enter another value different object type. example, want fetch character from string, enter index integer instead integer, which will raise type error string indices must integer. understand with help examples: Examples TypeError: String indices must integer Example Given string named JavaTpoint required fetch particular character from (Here, will discuss cases which type error arises above example, along with solution.) Case pass number string format instead integer value index. Python program fetch particular character from string print("Enter string: Enter string JavaTpoint s=input() print("To fetch character from string") s["4"] string begans with index value after onwards will further adding Explanation: above case, observe that, generates type error: string indices must integer because, fetch character 'from alphabet JavaTpoint, have pass index value integer form instead string. Here, pass value integer form, string form have assigned double-quotes. output case understand detail, with help correction mentioned below: Correction case Python program fetch particular character from string print("Enter string: Enter string JavaTpoint s=input() print("To fetch character from string") s[4] string begins with index value after onwards will further adding output correction case Case pass index's string value instead integer value. Python program fetch particular character from string print("Enter string: Enter string JavaTpoint s=input() print("To fetch character from string") s['o'] string begans with index value after onwards will further adding Explanation: above case, observe that, generating type error: string indices must integer because, here, fetch character from alphabet JavaTpoint, have pass index value integer form instead string. Here above program, pass alphabet directly rather than integer value, string form have assigned double-quotes. understand detail, with help correction mentioned below: output case Correction case Python program fetch particular character from string print("Enter string: Enter string JavaTpoint s=input() print("To fetch character from string") s[6] string begins with index value after onwards will further adding output correction case Example Given string named Wonderful required fetch particular slice from string part string from which called string slicing. Case pass number string format instead integer value index. Python program fetch particular part from string print("Enter string: Enter string Wonderful s=input() print("To fetch particular slice from string") s["3":"6"] string begans with index value after onwards will further adding Explanation: above case, generating type error: string indices must integer because, here, fetch particular part string from alphabet Wonderful, have pass index value integer form instead string. above program, need pass value integer form, string form have assigned double-quotes. output case understand detail, with help correction mentioned below: Correction case Python program fetch particular part from string print("Enter string: Enter string Wonderful s=input() print("To fetch particular slice from string") s[3:6] string begans with index value after onwards will further adding output correction case Example dictionary example, have given dictionary from which required fetch particular with corresponding value from dictionary. Case When pass string value index, instead integer value Python program fetch particular with corresponding value "Shivani" "Sneha" "Preeti" "Abhi" declaring dictionary print("Sneha: i["Sneha"]) print("Abhi: i["Abhi"]) above case, generating type error: string indices must integer because, here fetch particular Sneha from dictionary d1, have pass index which already integer form instead string. Here above program, pass string directly rather than integer value, string form have assigned double-quotes. output case understand detail, with help correction mentioned below: Correction case Python program fetch particular with corresponding value "Shivani" "Sneha" "Preeti" "Abhi" declaring dictionary print(i) output correction case Handling TypeError: String indices must integer above examples, that typeError could generated when enter string wrong format other than integer values. Although have seen correction examples, must know handle such exceptions. handle these exceptions python programming language, will generally except keyword, block. will enter test cases, which mainly much possible, which this possibility generating type error. will enter handle above exceptions except block printing user-defined error message. understand more detail with help example Example: python program handle type error exception ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Grapes"] declaring list indices "2", range(len(indices)): try: print(l1[indices[i]]) case which generates TypeError except TypeError: print("TypeError: Check list indices") output above example exception handling: Next TopicTime Series Forecasting with Prophet Python prev next
