next prev datetime.timedelta() Function Python 'timedelta()' function Python present datetime library, which usually used calculate differences given dates. also manipulate dates Python, this function makes very easy users manipulate dates. Syntax: Datetime.timedelta(days seconds microseconds milliseconds minutes hours weeks Return: Date better understanding, will show "datetime.timedelta()" function following example: Example this example, will print future dates three years three days: from datetime import datetime D_T, timedelta Using current time initializing_time_for_now D_T.now() print initial date print ("Initial Date: str(initializing_time_for_now)) Calculating future dates three years Future_Date_After_THREE_yrs initializing_time_for_now T_D(days 1095) Calculating future dates three days Future_Date_After_THREE_days initializing_time_for_now T_D(days Now, will print calculated future dates print('Future Date after Three years: str(Future_Date_After_THREE_yrs)) print('Future Date after Three days: str(Future_Date_After_THREE_days)) Output: Initial Date: 2021-10-14 00:09:43.611036 Future Date after years: 2023-10-15 00:09:43.611036 Future Date after days: 2021-10-17 00:09:43.611036 Example this example, will print past dates years hours: from datetime import datetime D_T, timedelta Using current time initializing_time_for_now D_T.now() print initial date print ("Initial Date:", str(initializing_time_for_now)) Calculating past dates year Past_Date_Before_TWO_yrs initializing_time_for_now timedelta(days 730) Calculating past dates hours Past_Date_Before_TWO_hours initializing_time_for_now timedelta(hours Now, will print calculated Past Dates print('Past date before years: str(Past_Date_Before_TWO_yrs)) print('Past date before hours: str(Past_Date_Before_TWO_hours)) Output: Initial Date: 2021-10-14 00:19:18.449629 Past date before years: 2019-10-15 00:19:18.449629 Past date before hours: 2021-10-13 22:19:18.449629 Example this example, will calculate difference between different dates: from datetime import datetime D_T, timedelta Using current time initializing_time_for_now D_T.now() print initial date print ("Initial Date:", str(initializing_time_for_now)) Some another datetime New_time initializing_time_for_now T_D(days hours milliseconds seconds New_time_1 initializing_time_for_now T_D(days hours milliseconds 215, seconds will print time print ("New calculated time: str(New_time)) Now, will print time difference between Dates: print('Time difference between given dates is:', str(New_time initializing_time_for_now)) print('Time difference between initial Date New_time_1 is:', str(New_time_1 initializing_time_for_now)) Output: Initial Date: 2021-10-14 00:31:13.920503 calculated time: 2021-10-21 06:31:25.975503 Time difference between given dates days, 6:00:12.055000 Time difference between initial Date New_time_1 days, 16:01:30.215000 Conclusion this tutorial, learned about 'datetime.timedelta()' function datetime library Python. have also discussed various examples better understanding concept manipulating dates calculating difference between dates.
