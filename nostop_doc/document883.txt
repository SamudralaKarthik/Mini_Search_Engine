next prev Introduction this section tutorial, going build real-time most popular python application known website blocker. This application used block websites that user open them during specific period. Let's discuss build such application using python. Objective objective Python website blocker block some certain websites which distract user during specified amount time. this, will block access list some particular websites during working hours that user only access those websites during free time only. working time this python application considered from time period except that time will considered free time. Process block access specific website computer, need configure hosts file. hosts file hosts file local file which used hostnames addresses days. Although service used nowadays hostnames addresses, host file still very complex used configure mapping addresses locally. Location hosts file location hosts file varies from operating system operating system. Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc Linux: /etc/hosts Configuration Since hosts file contains mapping between host names addresses, let's look content hosts file first stored /etc/hosts CentOS (Linux). above image, mappings saved localhost with address 127.0.0.1. Similarly, redirect hostname back localhost (127.0.0.1). will block access that hostname redirect that localhost each request. testimony, let's edit content hosts file some following lines make changes /etc/hosts file, will need change permissions. following command terminal change permissions. sudo chmod /etc/hosts following line file block access facebook.com (for example). 127.0.0.1		www.facebook.com shown image below. Save file open www.facebook.com using browser. shown above figure, refused connect. have completed task manually editing hosts file. haven't achieved objective yet. objective block access some particular websites (for example, facebook) during working hours only PM). needs python script which keeps adding necessary lines hosts file during particular period. this section tutorial, will build such python script which keeps editing hosts file during working hours. will also deploy that script startup that doesn't need external execution. Requirements need know following python modules build python website blocker. file handling: file handling used modifications hosts file. time: time module used control frequency modifications hosts file. datetime: datetime module used keep track free time working time.
