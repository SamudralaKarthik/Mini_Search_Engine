next prev Difference between Modules Packages Python often that many coders amateur programmers confuse between module package. problem generally arises when becomes hard identify when where module package should implemented. following tutorial, will discuss clear differences modules packages Python programming language that will make easy programmers work more professionally while dealing with both modules packages. Understanding Modules Python module pythonic statement containing different functions. Modules pre-defined library script, which accessible both programmers well user. python modules also store pre-defined functions from library when code being executed. consider example demonstrating module Python Example: importing library module import math from math import using pow() function pow(3, printing pow() print(pow) Output: <built-in function pow> Explanation: above snippet code, have imported required module used pow() function calculate powers given number arguments. have then printed value user. Understanding Packages Python package considered collection tools that allows programmers initiate code. Python package acts user-variable interface source code. This feature allows Python package work defined time functional script runtime. consider following example demonstrating package Python. Example: importing package import math printing statement print("We have imported math package") Output: have imported math package Explanation: above snippet code, have imported math package that consists various modules functions programmers printed statement users. Understanding differences between Python Modules Packages Package consists __init__.py file each user-oriented script. However, same does apply modules runtime script specified users. module file that contains Python script runtime code specified users. package also modifies user interpreted code such manner that gets easily operated runtime. python "module" contains unit namespace, with variables that extracted locally along with some parsed functions like: Constants Variables value Class definitions properties module generally corresponds single file debugging tool user interface library. There some usually utilized tools that allow programmers build platform with help modules better code executions. This installs distributes packages throughout library runtime well. becomes easier employ user-specific tools with help well-structured standard layout package. Next TopicSNMP module Python prev next
