next prev Polymorphism Python What polymorphism? Polymorphism refers having multiple forms. Polymorphism programming term that refers same function name, with different signatures, multiple types. Example in-built polymorphic functions: Python program demonstrating in-built poly-morphic functions len() function used string print (len("Javatpoint")) len() function used list print (len([110, 210, 130, 321])) Output: Examples user-defined polymorphic functions: here, simple Python function demonstrating Polymorphism add(p, 	return Driver code print (add(6, 23)) print (add(22, 544)) Output: 597 Polymorphism with Class Methods Below example Python different types classes same way. loops that iterate through multiple objects created. Next, call methods without caring about what class each object belongs These methods assumed exist every class. Example: class xyz(): 	def websites(self): 		print("Javatpoint website many availabe net.") 	def topic(self): 		print("Python many topics about technology Javatpoint.") 	def type(self): 		print("Javatpoint developed website.") class PQR(): 	def websites(self): 		print("Pinkvilla website many availabe net. 	def topic(self): 		print("Celebrities many topics.") 	def type(self): 		print("pinkvilla developing website.") obj_jtp xyz() obj_pvl PQR() domain (obj_jtp, obj_pvl): 	domain.websites() 	domain.topic() 	domain.type() Output: Javatpoint website many availabe net. Python many topics about technology Javatpoint. Javatpoint developed website. Pinkvilla website many availabe net. Celebrities many topics. pinkvilla developing website. Polymorphism with Inheritance: Polymorphism allows define methods Python that same methods parent classes. inheritance, methods parent class passed child class. possible change method that child class inherited from parent class. This especially useful when method that inherited from parent doesn't child's class. re-implement such methods child classes. This Method Overriding. Example: class Birds: intro1(self): print("There multiple types birds world.") flight1(self): print("Many these birds some cannot.") class sparrow1(Birds): flight1(self): print("Sparrows bird which fly.") class ostrich1(Birds): flight1(self): print("Ostriches birds which cannot fly.") obj_birds Birds() obj_spr1 sparrow1() obj_ost1 ostrich1() obj_birds.intro1() obj_birds.flight1() obj_spr1.intro1() obj_spr1.flight1() obj_ost1.intro1() obj_ost1.flight1() Output: There multiple types birds world. Many these birds some cannot. There multiple types birds world. Sparrows bird which fly. There multiple types birds world. Ostriches birds which cannot fly. Polymorphism with Function Objects also create functions that take object. This allows polymorphism. Let's take following example: let's make function called "func()", which will take object will call "obj". Even though name "obj", object that instantiated will able call into this function. Let's next give function something with 'obj object passed Let's call these three methods websites(), topic(), type(). Each them defined classes' xyz' 'PQR'. don't already have instantiations 'xyz" 'PQR classes, create them. then call their actions using same function func(). Example: func(obj): obj.websites() obj.topic() obj.type() obj_jtp xyz() obj_pvl PQR() func(obj_jtp) func(obj_pvl) Output: Javatpoint website many availabe net. Python many topics about technology Javatpoint. Javatpoint developed website. Pinkvilla website many availabe net. Celebrities many topics. pinkvilla developing website. Code: Implementing Polymorphism with Function class xyz(): websites(self): print("Javatpoint website many availabe net.") topic(self):	 print("Python many topics about technology Javatpoint.") type(self): print("Javatpoint developed website.") class PQR(): websites(self): print("Pinkvilla website many availabe net. topic(self): print("Celebrities many topics.") type(self):	 print("pinkvilla developing website.") func(obj): obj.websites() obj.topic() obj.type() obj_jtp xyz() obj_pvl PQR() func(obj_jtp) func(obj_pvl) Output: Javatpoint website many availabe net. Python many topics about technology Javatpoint. Javatpoint developed website. Pinkvilla website many availabe net. Celebrities many topics. pinkvilla developing website.
