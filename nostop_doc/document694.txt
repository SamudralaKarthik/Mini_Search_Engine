next prev Filter List Python While using shopping apps, suppose want T-shirt; type search bar, hundreds results appear. We'll have some criteria mind what want choose like amount money want spend T-shirt, colour etc. Hence, shopping apps provide 'filter' option using which only view results that already satisfy pre-defined criteria. same way, while working huge amounts data, we'll sometimes have filter data based some criteria. example, billion population India, want information about only people certain group, filter billion profiles based group. This tutorial discusses filter data stored list based need program with examples. First, list built-in data structure Python which store data different types. Students ["Jeevani", "Ramya", "Sanya"] Example Suppose have list with marks students particular subject, want filter marks less than here, criterion eliminate values less than Code: marks [30, marks: if(i 20): res.append(i) else: continue print(res) Output [30, Example Suppose have some characters list, want filter consonants list. characters ['a', 't', 'e', 'j', 'i', 'o', 'l'] vowels ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] characters: if(i vowels): res.append(i) else: continue print(res) Output ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o'] both above examples, created list appended elements from original list that satisfied criteria wanted. Another Approach: also create copy original list delete elements that satisfy criteria. Example: characters ['a', 't', 'e', 'j', 'i', 'o', 'k'] copy characters vowels ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] copy: if(i vowels): continue else: copy.remove(i) print(copy) Output ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o'] above code creates copy original characters list removes elements they don't exist vowels list. Python's built-in Function: These general approaches, Python language that makes everything simpler. provides built-in function called filter() that filters lists based criterion give. Syntax: filter(criterion, sequence) criterion: testing standard provide filter list. function checks every sequence element returns True when tested with criterion. sequence: data structure provide list, tuple, other iterable data type. function returns filtered sequence. take examples used earlier filter() works: #Filtering marks: criterion(orig): if(orig 20): return True else: return False marks [30, print(filter(criterion, marks)) list(filter(criterion, marks)) print(res) Output [30, Python 3.x, filter() returns object. Hence, need list() convert object into list. above code, created function criterion that checks given variable greater than Now, filter() with criterion data want with single line. Example: #Filtering consonants criterion(orig): vowels ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] if(orig vowels): return True else: return False characters ['a', 't', 'e', 'j', 'i', 'o', 'k'] list(filter(criterion, characters)) print(res) Output ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o'] Lambda Function filter(): Creating function every time need filter() tiring, mostly won't need other time. Hence, mostly lambda functions with function. don't know about lambda functions, here small promo: lambda function function without name-an anonymous function. take number arguments permits single expression. lambda function create function needed short time without much long-term significance. Syntax: lambda arguments expression Example: lambda print(x(3, Output Here same examples used earlier made easier using lambda functions: #Filtering marks marks [30, list(filter(lambda i>20, marks)) print(res) Output [30, #Filtering consonants characters ['a', 't', 'e', 'j', 'i', 'o', 'k'] list(filter(lambda ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'], characters)) print(res) Output ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o'] Filtering List Lists: Suppose doing investigation have list possible criminals. know that accused between Now, need filter lists: criminals [["Andy", 34], ["Roberto", 23], ["Joseph", 37], ["Ross", 21], ["Chandler", 23], ["Joey", 27]] filtered list(filter(lambda i[1] i[1] criminals)) print(filtered) Output [['Roberto', 23], ['Ross', 21], ['Chandler', 23], ['Joey', 27]] Next TopicPYTHON PROJECTS NETWORKING prev next
