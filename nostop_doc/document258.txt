next prev range() Xrange() Python this article, will discuss what range() xrange() function, they used Python, what essential features each. functions available Python used multiple parts program since they reduce size code value readability code. First, will have look what range function discuss some programs that involve usage. Similarly, then will understand what xrange function idea with help some programs. last, will look features each. range() Function- following example, will print first numbers starting from have specified value range function same provided space parameter that prints values with space. following program illustrates same- Example range(7): print(i, end=" Output: second example, will same thing again, that print first numbers starting from have specified value range function same provided space parameter that prints values with space. After this, will also check that what type does return. following program illustrates same- Example range(7): print(i,end=" print(type(range(7))) Output: next example, have defined list that contains elements. have specified value length list range function same provided space parameter that prints values with space. following program illustrates same- Example a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] range(len(a)): print(a[i],end=" Output: next example, will print values reverse order that lies range have specified value range function format start, stop end. have look each denote- start-The value from which would like start displaying elements. stop- value which would like stop displaying elements. step- step value refers value that indicates kind sequence expect results. default, value step following program illustrates same- Example range(10,-1,-1): print(i) Output: next example, will print numbers starting from this time using reversed method Python. have specified value range function same provided space parameter that prints values with space. following program illustrates same- Example reversed(range(21,31)): print(i,end=" Output: Xrange() Function xrange() function same purpose returns generator object used versions that came before Python syntax xrange same range() which means xrange also have specify start, stop step. using Python execute program using xrange then will generate error since this version onwards range() used. Let's what happens when following program Python- Example range(1,10,2): print(i) xrange(10,20,2): print(j) Output: Comparison between Range() Xrange() Here will compare both based consumption memory, return type, speed operations- Parameters Range() Xrange() Consumption Memory Since range() returns list elements, takes more memory. comparison range(), takes less memory. Return type returns list integers. returns generator object. Speed execution speed slower. execution speed faster. Operations Since returns list, kinds arithmetic operations performed. Such operations cannot performed xrange(). Next TopicWordcloud Package Python prev next
