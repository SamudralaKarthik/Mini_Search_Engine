next prev Python String equals string succession characters. person just image. instance, English language characters. don't manage characters; they manage numbers (twofold). Despite fact that might characters your screen, inside, away controlled 1s. This transformation character number called encoding, converse interaction interpreting. ASCII Unicode portion famous encodings utilized. make string Python? Strings made encasing characters inside solitary statement twofold statements. Indeed, even triple statements utilized Python but, large, used address multiline strings docstrings. Example defining strings Python following equivalent my_str 'Hello' print(my_str) my_str "Hello" print(my_str) my_str '''Hello''' print(my_str) triple quotes string extend multiple lines my_str """Hello, welcome world Python""" print(my_str) Output: Hello Hello ''Hello Hello, welcome world Python individual characters utilizing ordering scope characters utilizing cutting. list begins from Attempting person list reach will raise IndexError. file ought integer. cannot floating other types; doing will cause TypeError. Python's arrangements support negative ordering. reference file final item, file second, keep continuing item, etc. Through cutting administrator, reach variety objects string: (colon). Example #Accessing string characters Python 'appleshake' print('str str) #first character print('str[0] str[0]) #last character print('str[-1] str[-1]) #slicing character print('str[1:5] str[1:5]) #slicing last character print('str[5:-2] str[5:-2]) Output: appleshake str[0] str[-1] str[1:5] pple str[5:-2] sha String correlation fundamentally examination strings. example, technique through which check balance strings looking strings character-by-character. Strategy Python '==' administrator look uniformity strings Python Comparison administrators utilized look strings check their uniformity delicate situation way. example, capitalized letters lowercase letters would dealt with unexpected way. Python '==' administrator looks string person-by-character returns True event that strings equivalent. case, gets back False. Syntax string1 string2 Example "Python" "Python" "Java" print(s1 print(s1 Output: True False Strategy Python '!=' administrator String examination Python '!=' administrator likewise utilized play string rises really look python. '!=' administrator thinks about strings returns True chance that strings inconsistent, case, gets back False. Syntax string1 string2 Example: "Python" "Python" "Java" if(s1 s3): print("s1 equal s3") if(s1 s2): print("s1 equal s2") else: print("s1 equal s2") Output: equal equal Strategy Python 'is' administrator perform string rises actually take look python Python "is" administrator utilized proficiently check uniformity string objects. administrator returns True assuming that factors highlight similar information objects. Else, gets back False. Syntax: variable1 variable2 Example: "Python" "Python" "Java" if(s1 s3): print("s1 equal s3") else: print("s1 equal s3") if(s1 s2): print("s1 equal s2") else: print("s1 equal s2") Output: equal equal Strategy __eq__() capability perform string approaches actually looked python Python's in-assembled __eq__() strategy utilized look two-string objects. __eq__() technique essentially thinks about articles returns True whenever seen equivalent. case, gets back False. Syntax: string1.__eq__(string2) Example: "Python" "Python" "Java" if(s1.__eq__(s3)): print("s1 equal s3") else: print("s1 equal s3") if(s1.__eq__(s2)): print("s1 equal s2") else: print("s1 equal s2") Output: equal equal String equals check Python caseless comparison Example "Python" "PYTHON" if(s1.__eq__(s2)): print("s1 equal s2") else: print("s1 equal s2" Output: equal found above model, outcome ends being FALSE, light fact that examination Case-touchy. have caseless string examination, example, situation coldhearted way, then, that point, utilize Python string.casefold() capability fill need. string.casefold() technique switches string over completely lowercase immediately. situation string examination, pass both info strings casefold() capability. Consequently, both string would changed over completely lowercase, subsequently, have caseless examination. Syntax: string.casefold() Example "Python" "PYTHON" "PYthoN" if((s1.casefold()).__eq__(s2.casefold())): print("s1 equal s2") else: print("s1 equal s2") if((s1.casefold()) (s3.casefold())): print("s1 equal s3") else: print("s1 equal s3") Output: equal equal Next TopicControl Statements Python prev next
