next prev Python Program Word Guessing Game Python extremely versatile programming language employed many large companies. simple easy-to-understand syntax, which makes perfect those trying master computer programming first time. high-level programming language. fundamental design principle about understanding code syntax that lets programmers communicate concepts within lines code. this tutorial, we'll "random module" play interactive game word guessing. This game intended those just beginning learn code Python will give them overview strings, loops, conditional (If, otherwise) statements. Random Module: Sometimes, need computer choose random number from specified range, choose element randomly from set, choose random card from assortment decks, flip coin, random module allows ability access functions that support these kinds operations. these operations random.choice() technique (returns unspecified item from tuple, list, string.) which we'll make choose random words from terms we've generated. Word Guessing Game: game involves array words from which interpreter will select random word. player must first input their names challenged guess alphabet their choice after that. random word comprised alphabet, will displayed output (with proper placement); otherwise, program will prompt choose alternative alphabet. Users will given turns (can modified according to) determine full word. Below example Python implementation: Code: First, will import library that will using choose random words from list words import random Here user will asked enter their name first name1 input("What your NAME print("Best Luck! name1) words1 ['Donkey', 'Aeroplane', 'America', 'Program', 'Python', 'language', 'Cricket', 'Football', 'Hockey', 'Spaceship', 'bus', 'flight'] rdm.choice() function will choose random word from gven list words word1 rdm.choice(words1) print ("Please guess characters: guesses1 number turns here turns1 while turns1 counting number times user failed guess right character failed1 characters from input word will taken time. char word1: here, will comparing that input character with character guesses1 char guesses1: print(char) else: print("_") every failure user will incremented failed1 failed1 failed1 user will game failure 'User Win' will given output print("User Win") this will print correct word print("The correct word word1) break user input wrong alphabet then will user enter another alphabet guess1 input("Guess another character:") every input character will stored guesses guesses1 guess1 here, will check input with character word guess1 word1: turns1 input character doesnot match word then "Wrong Guess" will given output print("Wrong Guess") this will print number turns left user print("You have turns1, 'more guesses turns1 print("User Loose") Output: What your NAME JavaTpoint Best Luck! JavaTpoint Please guess characters: Guess another character: Wrong Guess have more guesses Guess another character: Wrong Guess have more guesses Guess another character: Wrong Guess have more guesses Guess another character: Wrong Guess have more guesses Guess another character: Wrong Guess have more guesses Guess another character: Wrong Guess have more guesses Guess another character: Guess another character: Guess another character: Guess another character: Guess another character: Guess another character: User correct word Program Conclusion this tutorial, have discussed random module, developing word guessing game Python.
