next prev Python Module xxHash xxhash Python module xxHash library Yann Collet. xxHash Extremely quick Hash calculation, running speed limits. effectively finishes SMHasher test suite, which assesses hash capabilities' impact, scattering, irregularity characteristics. Code profoundly convenient, hashes indistinguishable across stages (nearly nothing/large endian). Execution huge information just single piece image. Hashing additionally exceptionally helpful developments like hash tables blossom channels. these utilization cases, it's continuous hash little information (beginning couple bytes). Calculation's presentation totally different such situations, since parts calculation, like statement conclusion, become fixed cost. effect branch mis-forecast additionally turns importantly more present. XXH3 been intended superb execution long little information sources. Quality Speed isn't main property that important. Created hash values should regard phenomenal scattering haphazard properties that sub-segment tends utilized fanning table file, well lessen much crashes insignificant hypothetical level following birthday problem. xxHash been tried with Austin Appleby's superb SMHasher test suite breezes through assessments, guaranteeing sensible quality levels. likewise finishes broadened assessments from more current forks SMHasher, including extra situations conditions. long last, xxHash gives huge crash analyzer, ready produce contrast billions hashes with test constraints 64-cycle hash calculations. this front, xxHash includes great outcomes following birthday oddity. Build modifiers accompanying macros gathering time alter libxxhash's behaving. They are, large, debilitated, course. XXH_INLINE_ALL: Make capabilities inline, with executions being straightforwardly included inside xxhash.h. Inlining capabilities valuable speed little keys. It's viable when length communicated consistent order time, with execution upgrades seen +200% territory. XXH_PRIVATE_API: same result XXH_INLINE_ALL. Still accessible heritage support. name underlines that XXH_* images won't traded. XXH_NAMESPACE: Prefixes images with worth XXH_NAMESPACE. This full scale utilize compilable person set. Valuable sidestep image naming impacts there should occurrence various incorporations xxHash's source code. Client applications utilize customary capability names, images consequently deciphered through xxhash.h. XXH_FORCE_MEMORY_ACCESS: default strategy purposes compact memcpy() documentation. Strategy uses gcc-explicit pressed characteristic, which better execute certain objectives. Technique powers unaligned peruses, which isn't guidelines agreeable; however could again best remove better read execution. Technique purposes byteshift activity, which best compilers which don't inline memcpy() large endian frameworks without byte swap guidance XXH_FORCE_ALIGN_CHECK: quicker immediate read when info adjusted. This choice improve emotional execution when contribution hash adjusted 32-digit limits while running structures incapable stacking memory from unaligned addresses experiencing presentation punishment. (somewhat) hindering stage with great unaligned memory access execution (same guidance both adjusted unaligned gets to). This choice naturally crippled x64, x84, aarch64, empowered remaining stages. XXH_VECTOR physically select vector guidance (default: auto-chose gathering time). Accessible guidance sets XXH_VSX, XXH_SSE, XXH_SCALAR, XXH_AVX2, XXH_NEON, XXH, AVX512. compiler might require extra banners guarantee appropriate help (for instance, Linux will require mavx2 AVX3, mavx512f AVX512). XXH_NO_PREFETCH cripple prefetching. stages circumstances might perform better without prefetching. XXH3, were. XXH3, were. XXH_PREFETCH_DIST select distance prefetching. near metal transformation explicit equipment stages. XXH_NO_STREAM: streaming Disabled, restricting just single shot variations. XXH_SIZE_OPT: default, upgrade speed default Os Oz: handicaps some speed hacks size advancement make code little could expected, execution might cry XXH_NO_INLINE_HINTS: default, xxHash utilizes __attribute__((always_inline)) __forceinline further develop execution expense code size. Characterizing this full scale will check inward capabilities static, permitting compiler choose whether inline capability not. This exceptionally helpful while upgrading littlest double size naturally characterized while gathering with Os, O0, fno, Oz-inline Clang GCC. This likewise increment execution relying upon compiler engineering. XXH32_ENDJMP: Switch multi-branch conclusion phase XXH32 solitary leap. This bothersome execution, particularly while hashing contributions irregular sizes. However, contingent upon careful design compiler, leap could give somewhat better execution little information sources. Impaired naturally. XXH_NO_STDLIB: Disable summon <stdlib.h> capabilities, remarkably malloc() free(). libxxhash's XXH*_createState() will constantly fizzle bring NULL back. However, single shot hashing (like XXH32()) streaming utilizing statically designated states fill true form. This form banner helpful implanted conditions without dynamic assignment. XXH_STATIC_LINKING_ONLY: gives admittance inward state announcement, expected static portion. Contrary dynamic connecting, because dangers ABI changes. XXH_NO_XXH3: eliminates images connected with XXH3 pieces) from created paired. Helpful decrease parallel size quiet applications that don't utilize XXH3. XXH_NO_LONG_LONG: eliminates aggregation calculations depending 64-bit types (XXH3 XXH64). Just XXH32 will aggregated. Helpful targets (models compilers) without 64-cycle support. XXH_IMPORT: MSVC explicit: ought just characterized dynamic connecting, forestalls linkage mistakes. XXH_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN: default, stone runtime test settled order time. chance that, reasons unknown, compiler can't rearrange runtime test, cost execution. It's feasible skip auto-location express that design little-endian setting this full scale states enormous endian. XXH_DEBUGLEVEL When esteem empowers declare() articulations. This (somewhat) dials back execution help track bugs during troubleshooting meetings.
