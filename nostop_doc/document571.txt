next prev Import Datasets using sklearn PyBrain this tutorial, will explain import datasets with Sklearn within PyBrain. Dataset described collection data that could used test, validate well train networks. When compared with arrays that considered more flexible, dataset thought more flexible easier work with. dataset akin two-dimensional array. data sets used execute tasks machine learning. Libraries would needing this tutorial are: sklearn Pybrain Syntax install these libraries: !pip3 install sklearn pybrain Example this example, firstly, have imported packages datasets from sklearn library ClassificationDataset from pybrain.datasets. After that, loaded numbers dataset. next line, will define feature variables targets variables. then create algorithm classification dataset creating inputs, output well classes. then information dataset created. Code: First will import libraries from sklearn import datasets from pybrain.datasets import ClassificationDataSet Here, will load digits loaded_digits1 DS.load_digits() Now, will data items Q_data, P_data loaded_digits1.data, loaded_digits1.target now, will upload Classification dataset dataset1 CDS(64, nb_classes=15) Now, will perform Iterations over length range(len(Q_data)): 	dataset1.addSample(Q_data[k], P_data[k]) Print dataset print(dataset1) Output: Example this example, firstly, have imported packages datasets from sklearn library ClassificationDataset from pybrain.datasets. After that, loaded Iris dataset. next line, will define feature variables targets variables. Then, create algorithm classifying dataset defining four inputs, output, classes. After that, added data newly created dataset. Code: First will import libraries from sklearn import datasets from pybrain.datasets import ClassificationDataSet Here, will load iris loaded_digits1 DS.load_iris() Now, will data items Q_data, P_data loaded_digits1.data, loaded_digits1.target now, will create Classification dataset dataset1 CDS(4, nb_classes=2) Now, will perform Iterations over length range(len(Q_data)): 	dataset1.addSample(Q_data[k], P_data[k]) Print dataset print(dataset1) Output: Conclusion: this tutorial have discussed import various datasets using sklearn library PyBrain.
