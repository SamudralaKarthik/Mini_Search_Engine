next prev What script mode Python? integrate systems more efficiently work very quickly with help Python programming language. Python high-level, widely used general-purpose programming language, designed with emphasis improving readability code. syntax Python allows programmers express concept just lines code rather than writing many lines code like other programming languages. have following types ways which code Python programming language: Using interactive mode Using script mode this tutorial, going learn about script mode Python. will learn what script mode Python program using script mode, advantages script mode. Let's start with first understanding what script mode Python Script mode Python system writing scripts anything referred script etymologically. first write Python program inside file (like script) script mode, then execute file after saving system. Script mode Python where first write Python program inside script file execute after that. execute script code either using command prompt using Python installed system. script mode, anytime view code that have written inside file, modify before executing next time. That's editing Python code becomes quite easy script mode, edit view code many times want. write long pieces code with script mode, that's many expert programmers prefer over interactive mode execution. Python file create using script mode usually saved default inside folder where Python installed, saved with Python file (".py") extension. Running Python program script mode After have learned about script mode execution Python, question that comes mind that Python program using script mode. this section, will answer this question learn ways which execute Python script. before executing Python program script, let's first create save system. Creating saving Python program script file: have follow following steps sequence order create save Python program script device: Step Open text editor Python other text editor choice will using Python file editor here). Step Write following Python program inside text editor: Taking variables from user int(input("Enter number integer value: int(input("Enter second integer number: Addition input variables Printing addition result output print("The addition numbers given have written down: Step After writing Python program, have save file inside folder where Python installed, have save with Python file extension, i.e., '.py' extension. have saved file with 'code.py' name device this program. Python script having Python program successfully created saved device, move forward execute script. Executing Python Program Script Now, have execute Python program script order output program, have ways going following ways execute Python program script: Executing using command prompt terminal Executing using Python Let's learn about each method separately execute script file. Method Executing Python script using command prompt terminal: execute script file (code.py) using command prompt terminal system. output file will also displayed terminal shell. execute Python script file, have follow following steps: Step Open command prompt terminal locate directory where Python installed system (same where have saved Python script file). locate directory, directory path with 'cd' did: Now, after writing directory path, press enter locate directory command prompt. Step Now, have write script file name (with extension), have write python before script file name follows: Step When press enter key, Python will start executing script file command prompt terminal. When give input values required code, even output program inside command prompt. That's execute Python script file command prompt terminal system. Method Executing Python script using Python Other than executing Python script through command prompt terminal, also execute script file directly using Python installed system. execute Python script file using Python IDE, have follow following steps: Step Open Python open script file Python using open option given. Step Now, after opening file, will option top: even 'F5' button shortcut script file Python IDE. that script file (code.py) started executing Python IDE, once give required input values, output program inside Python shell like following: Output: Enter number integer value: Enter second integer number: addition numbers given That's execute Python script file using Python installed system. Advantages script mode Now, last, let's look advantages using script mode execution Python program over interactive mode execution. Following advantages script mode execution: Script mode execution very much suitable write long Python programs (programs having more than single code line). easily editing Python program inside script mode. open Python program many times want inside script mode. script mode, even save code have written future. Script mode execution mostly preferred experts Python programmers. Conclusion this tutorial, have learned about script mode execution Python. have learned ways which script mode execution execute Python program. last, have seen advantages script mode execution Python, looking these advantages, easily that experts programmers prefer script mode execution over interactive mode execution.
