next prev Converting JSON Python this tutorial, will understand convert formatted file JSON formatted file with help Python programming language. begin, understand what JSON files mean. What file? file, short Comma Separated Values file, plain text file that stores list data. files generally utilized exchange data between various applications. instance, Contact Managers Databases generally provide file support. These files also known Comma Delimited Files Character Separated Values. These files mainly utilize comma character order delimit separate data. However, sometimes utilize other characters such semicolons. anticipation export complex data from program formatted file then import data from file into another program. Comma Separated Values (CSV) file pretty basic structure containing some data listed separated commas. files designed that they import export data from other applications easily. resultant data easily read humans viewed with text editor such Notepad spreadsheet application such Microsoft Excel Google Sheets. What JSON file? JSON file, also short JavaScript Object Notation file, file that allows users store basic objects data structure standard data interchange format called JSON format. JSON file generally utilized order transmit data between web-based application server. JSON files lightweight text-based files that humans easily read, edit these files with help text editor like Notepad. format JSON genuinely based JavaScript subset. However, referred language-independent format supported variety programming APIs. JSON generally utilized Ajax Application Programming. There been gradual growth popularity JSON when compared alternative over past years. While there various programs that JSON data interchange, they save JSON format files their hard drive. data interchange takes place between Computers connected over Internet. Nevertheless, programs allow save JSON format files. instance, Google+ uses JSON file save Profile Data. Once logged choose "Data liberation" page select "Download your Profile data" option. Since JSON files plain text files which allows open them text editor, such Microsoft Notepad Windows, Apple TextEdit Mac, Vim Linux, GitHub Atom, also browsers like Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox order open JSON format files. begin with conversion file JSON file. Conversion file JSON file will convert file into JSON file with help simple Python program scripted below. will using following file. File: mydatalist.csv Program: importing required libraries import import json defining function convert file JSON file convjson(csvFilename, jsonFilename): creating dictionary mydata reading data from file with open(csvFilename, encoding 'utf-8') csvfile: csvRead csv.DictReader(csvfile) Converting rows into dictionary adding data rows csvRead: mykey rows['S. No.'] mydata[mykey] rows dumping data with open(jsonFilename, 'w', encoding 'utf-8') jsonfile: jsonfile.write(json.dumps(mydata, indent filenames csvFilename r'mydatalist.csv' jsonFilename r'mydatalist.json' Calling convjson function convjson(csvFilename, jsonFilename) Output: File: mydatalist.json "1": No.": "1", "Name": "Dave", "Age": "17" "2": No.": "2", "Name": "Albus", "Age": "16" "3": No.": "3", "Name": "John", "Age": "19" "4": No.": "4", "Name": "Tom", "Age": "22" "5": No.": "5", "Name": "Harry", "Age": "19" "6": No.": "6", "Name": "Ron", "Age": "20" "7": No.": "7", "Name": "William", "Age": "13" "8": No.": "8", "Name": "George", "Age": "15" "9": No.": "9", "Name": "Mark", "Age": "11" "10": No.": "10", "Name": "Max", "Age": "18" Explanation: above example, have imported json libraries defined function convjson(). have then created empty dictionary read data from file. have converted rows from dictionary them data. have then dumped data into JSON file. last, have defined variables file path names called convjson() function implement conversion. result, when executed program, file successfully converted JSON file.
