next prev Learning Vector Quantization Learn Vector Quantization LVQ) type Artificial Neural Network that also influenced biological model that represents neural networks. based prototype algorithm supervised learning classification. developed network using algorithm competitive learning similar Self Organizing Map. also able deal with problem multiclass classification. composed layers, which input layer, second called Output. structure Learning Vector Quantization with number classes that input data numbers features that input every sample found below: Learning Vector Quantization works? Let's suppose that have input data size (m number) with being training samples, while refers number components each instance arbitrary label vector size m). Then, initialized with weights size from initial number training samples that have different labels. They must removed samples training. this case, indication classes. Then, iterate over remaining input information each example training that changes winner vector (weight vector) with closest distance (e.g., Euclidean distance from example training weight updation rules provided correctly_classified: wij(new) wij(old) alpha(t) (xik wij(old)) else: wij(new) wij(old) alpha(t) (xik wij(old)) Where alpha represents learning rate over time award-winning vector. addition, characteristic training example, represents number training sample using input dataset. After training network, weights trained used classify examples. instance labelled class that winning. Algorithm steps involved include: Weight initialization From Epochs Select good training example Find winning vector Make sure update vector that winning Repeat steps every exercise example. Classify test samples Below implementation.
