next prev Features Python 3.10 Python gained much popularity become highly demanded programming language industry. There many reasons developers show their love this programming language, such versatile, rich libraries, friendly syntax, ease learning, many others. another interesting reason that Python comes with exciting useful features newly released versions. Python Software Developer Foundation (PSF) maintains, develops language always working ways improve more recent version Python 3.10, which released October 2021. PSF working Python 3.11, available testing. However, this tutorial, will discuss unique features Python 3.10 they differ from previous one. want learn about Python programming language, then visit Python tutorial. Let's learn about features Python 3.10. Better Error Tracking Errors integral part software development, encounter errors daily. Every programmer knows frustrating syntax error. However, Python straightforward syntax, after some practice, idea fixing Python returns proper error messages that help locate error more efficiently save time debugging. Python 3.10 comes with better error messages precise line numbers debugging. Let's understand following example where create dictionary function. skip close parentheses; now, let's what return. Example student "Arun", 'Tusar', 'Himanshu', 'Abhinay' some_function() print(student) When above code, will give following error. previous version Python, error messages shown below. Output: some_function() SyntaxError: invalid syntax However, Python 3.10, error message line numbering improvement, message will have complete information such exact types error their precise line number. Output: File "example_code.py", line student "Arun", 'Tusar', 'Himanshu', 'Abhinay' SyntaxError: never closed Suppose working project with enormous numbers line code. With this type message, quickly locate correct errors, making debugging much faster decreasing frustration people just learning Python. Type Union Operator reasons popularity Python dynamic nature. Though, there several ways make some portion Python dynamic. previous version Python, specify type attributes inside function. Let's understand following example Example func(num: int) int: return But, function limited take only type argument; union keyword specify multi-type attributes. Let's understand following example. Example func(num: Union[int, float]) Union[int, float]: return However, newer version Python allows operator instead union choose between data types. Example func(num: float) float: return Automatic Text Encoding Many times heard that this code working perfectly machine, yours? There many reasons, like text encoding. older version Python, don't explicitly state encoding type, preferred local encoding cause failure other machine. Python 3.10 shows warning message user opens text file without specific encoding type. Python provides charade library detect convert into standard encoding. Asynchronous Iteration Asynchronous programming valuable powerful programming paradigm, been part Python since version 3.5. However, Python 3.10 comes with additional methods aiter() anext(), make more useful. Python essential programming language inspire younger generation pursue career tech. Apart from being easy language fast developers start implement continuously evolving, Python Software Foundation works keep relevant. Stricter Zipping zip() function Python unique valuable. This built-in function allows combine iterate over elements from several sequences. previous version Python 3.10, combine sequences different lengths. Python 3.10 introduced parameter strict that checks iterables passed functions, same size. Structural Pattern Matching have ever worked with other programming languages like C++, wish that Python should have switch statement that omit long elif, elif, ....., else statement. Python 3.10 additional feature structural pattern matching, otherwise known switch case statement. syntax given below. Syntax match subject: case <patt1>: <act1> case <patt2>: <act2> case <patt3>: <act3> case <action_default> Atomic Grouping speedups regex know, Python provides module that works with regular expression. lacked features other implementations regular expressions, that atomic grouping. atomic grouping widely supported different programming language Python. Python 3.10 supports this pattern using standard syntax atomic grouping example >.....)). module's pattern matching engine also been rewritten runs about 100% faster. Conclusion This tutorial included features Python 3.10 version. have explored some essential useful features, including strict zipping, structural pattern matching, asynchronous iteration, type union operator, etc. also some other features, have explained important ones.
