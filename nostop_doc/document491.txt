next prev Basic Python Java Developers Python general-purpose language programming. easy understand growth Python over past years looking ease learning well ability used machine learning data analysis addition design. What type programming language What main differentiators case Java against Python? What have gain from this tutorial, will learn about Python from Java viewpoint. After reading tutorial, we'll able determine Python solution problems recognize utilize Python along with Java specific types problems. Where Does Python Come From? Python programming language created through Guido Rossum. search interest-based programming project keep busy during Christmas season 1989. That's time began develop Python interpreter. Python originates from several languages, including ABC, Modula-3. It's object-oriented, imperative programming language. Based personal preference functionality want, possible fully object-oriented style procedural programming style that includes functions. object-oriented programming capabilities will discussed next section this tutorial. beginning 2021, TIOBE announced Python "programming language year" fourth time. According 2021's Octoverse report, Python ranks second most used programming language GitHub contributors repository. What Philosophy Python? Soon, will Python sections that follow this one. beginning, however, will examine it's important familiar with Python more thoroughly studying features connect philosophy Python. concepts about Java well Python compared; however, each software language comes with distinctive characteristic. core philosophy behind Python described fundamental principles, which known Python. Python full hidden Easter eggs, them known Python. Take look what happens when following command within Python read-eval-print loop (REPL): import this Output: While it's advisable take above statements seriously, handful them directly relates traits will examining next section. When look principles Python, will have idea best work using language. Python Code Readable from Java background looking ordinary piece Python software, believe that viewing pseudo-code. Several elements contribute this: Indentation used create grouping statements. This helps make code blocks shorter encourages consistent style coding. There will more information this issue later. high-level built-in data structures, paired with smallest collection operator symbols, make Python extremely expressive. option using exceptions primary method handle errors helps keep code tidy. Python programmers favour approach programming that influenced notion that it's Easier Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP) instead "Look Before Leap" (LBYL) concept. This style focuses usual, happy path program. will able determine irregularities dealt with following. Python Comes with Libraries Included goal Python tackle majority everyday issues using distribution, which default version Python. order achieve this, Python includes what's called standard library. Like Java Class Library, it's large collection useful features comprised constants, functions frameworks, classes. Python Promotes Code Reuse Python offers variety options that allow write code that could reuse over over again implement Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. important note that Python package modules differ distinct from Java package modules. Another feature that typically break down program code module well package inside Python. would like know these ideas work from point view Python developer, learn more about Python packages modules. Another method employ within Python object-oriented programming. We'll discuss this another section this tutorial. Additionally, make decorators alter Python classes, functions, methods. Another method decorate Python code allow program functionality just once. Then able utilized from class, function, method that have decorated. Python Easily Extensible ability support packages modules element that makes simple features Python adding functions. It's also possible create different modified behaviours Python common functions operators overriding them. even influence method which classes constructed. easiest expand Python writing program using pure Python. also possible define modules making bindings simplified version Python known Cython well C++. Start Discovering Python? this tutorial, will examples that will encourage look into certain areas test Python code fragments ourselves. experienced Java programmer, could recall initial steps learning about Java well installing first Java Development Kit. looking begin using Python, will need install Then, sandbox which play around with Installing Python first step install recent version Python. order that, follow this "How install Python". Many Python programmers contribute their code libraries that work with different Python versions. They typically prefer test pre-release version Python without disrupting their normal Python work. these situations, it's beneficial access multiple different versions Python same system. tool that provide that capability pyenv, similar Java's jEnv. Creating Sandbox Using second step, must establish virtual machine ensure that able benefit from open-source Python ecosystem. This section will explain what need should take this step. While Python comprehensive Standard Library with wide range functions, there more features accessible through other packages that, among them, majority them free. Python Package Index, also known Python Package Index PyPI, shorten primary central repository that gathers distributes packages. possible install packages using command. Before install them, must first read following paragraphs. avoid conflicts between versions dependency, Sharing personal global Python installation with other projects generally recommended. practice, will able have accompany each experimentation project Sandbox with online environment. projects remain independent each other. This method also avoids versions conflicting between different packages. would like know more about this procedure, learn entire article "How create virtual environment Python". Choosing Editor Integrated Development Environment final phase making setup, select editor choose already familiar with IntelliJ IDEs, PyCharm appears most appropriate choice it's part similar line products. Another editor that rise Visual Studio Code. However, able select from numerous other choices. Once have installed Python learned install external programs into environment that virtual have selected either editor IDE, begin play around with language. While read through whole tutorial, there will many opportunities practice test. Python Different from Java? It's easy understand what type program Python examining where most notable differences are. sections below, will discover main ways which Python differs from Java. Indentation Code Block Grouping Perhaps most striking aspect Python found syntax. Particularly, define classes, functions, flow-control constructs, well code blocks different from familiar with. Java, mark code blocks using well-known curly braces Python, different. indicate codes blocks using indentation level. Here's example indentation influences code block's grouping parity(number1): result1 "odd number" Function body number1 result1 "even number" Body if-block return result1 part if-block num1 range(4): part functio print("Number", num1, "is", parity(num1)) Body for-loop print("This part loop") part for-loop code demonstrates following concepts: Line This statement first step describing brand function called parity() that takes argument known number. should have used statement class definition block. would have initiated method definition instead. Line Inside parity(), body function begins indented level. assign "odd number" string result variable first line. Line This beginning Line extra line creates block. block executed when conditional expression expression, number evaluates true. this example, comprised line, where variable assigned "even number" result variable. Line dedent line that precedes return statement signifies expression block. Line Likewise, notice indentation that precedes start loop. This point which have reached block that defines functions. Therefore, evident that loop begins same indent beginning block definitions functions starting first line. Line similar thing happening initial print() function call part loop block. Line second, dedented print() function call isn't part loop block. possible that user have observed that addition colon :) line starts entirely block code. indented step. This block code completed with next sentence being dedented second time. code block should comprise least statement. empty code block isn't possible. there's statement required, then make "pass statement" that does nothing way. also have been aware that utilize hash symbol make comments. example above will produce following outputs: Number even number This part loop Number number This part loop Number even number This part loop Number number This part loop While this method defining blocks might seem first glance could even turn you, reality that people become used much faster than think today. There great stylistic guidelines that used Python code called suggests using indentation that four positions using spaces. style guide does recommend tabs sources code file. reason that various editors terminals system could utilize different stop locations render code different ways different users across different operating systems. Read-Eval-Print Loop from Beginning Since beginning, Python always inbuilt read-eval-print loop (REPL). REPL examines shortest complete expression, statement, block, then compiles into bytecode evaluates code evaluated results object other than None object, produces clear version object. explanation None next section this tutorial. Example: zero int(0) zero Output: float(zero) Output: complex(zero) Output: 0j bool(zero) Output: False str(zero) Output: observe, interpreter strives display expressions clearly concisely. above example, that integer floating-point complicated, Boolean well string values presented different way. main differentiator between Java Python assignment operator =). standard Python assignment, which employs equals sign that single character, declaration, expression, which could result value object. This REPL does display assignment that variable zero statements always evaluated none. line after assignment includes variable expression zero instruct REPL print resultant variable, regardless expression. REPL, underscore variable holds value most recent expression, provided that it's None. following example shows utilize this particular variable: Example: Output: Output: Output: some_var Output: some_var Output: When have assigned number some_var variable remains with it's value This because assignment statement evaluated None. Dynamically Typed Strongly Typed characteristic programming languages what, how, what compiler interpreter does type verification. Python languages that dynamic typed language. means type functions, variables, return values functions checked during runtime instead compile-time contrast Java. Python simultaneously very strongly written language: objects have specific type connected with them. clear conversion required between different types. this tutorial, will learn ways that Python tests compatibility types during execution ways create types that compatible: Example: Output: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) ----> TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) 'int' 'str' Input: int("2") numbers Output: Input: str(40) Concatenate strings Output: '402' Input: Repeat string forty times Output: '2222222222222222222222222222222222222222' It's obvious that cannot simply integer existing string value. This guarded runtime. interpreter able detect error runtime that causes exception, raises alarm. REPL detects exception instances displays traceback that leads incorrect expression. solve issue, convert type object another. wish join objects form numbers, then convert string that represents number plain number employed int() constructor. would prefer combine objects using strings, convert number strings employing str() constructor. final sentence Python session above demonstrates different characteristic. When multiply sequence with number, will concatenated version sequence that originally multiplied number specify. Even though Python open-source language that dynamically typed, possible supply code using type annotations. runtime phase, Python does nothing with annotations except make them accessible introspection. However, static type-checker tools available detect contradictions between declarations types actual usage annotations type-annotated classes, functions, variables. Type annotations allow spot issues early point development process. Particularly big-scale projects software, they making code manageable help maintain order. common invoke static type checker part verification process within build pipeline. majority IDEs employ annotations type types addition. CPython Compiler Most likely, most widely used Python implementer been CPython. It's also reference implementation. CPython described interpreter compiler created using accessible platform. Python reference implementation does have compiler, unlike Java. CPython loads initial source file, known module. Module loaded steps: Compilation: first step that CPython analyses source code then compiles "bytecode" which instructions that CPython interpreter run. limited way, able examine compilation process relation Java's javac compiles .java file into .class Execution: This when CPython bytecode interpreter, also known CPython's virtual machine (VM), executes bytecode generated first step. Contrary mainstream Java implementations, CPython does convert bytecode code into native code objects. However, there different Python implementations that operate differently. There's Python implementation that runs Java platform, dubbed Jython. runs direct interoperability among Java with Python. There's also alternative known IronPython, which uses .NET implementation uses "Just-in-Time" (JIT) compiler called PyPy. average case, PyPy speed times more efficient than CPython. end, GraalVM extremely fast runtime that used with numerous programming languages. offers experimental version support relatively current Python version. above list isn't comprehensive. Python website extensive list alternatives solutions well distributions. Built-in Function Operator Overloading Java programmer, could familiar with what overloading from method overloading. dynamic version available Python, which provides similar function. There another overloading available Python that might find more efficient. design behaviours custom-built classes Python included functions operators. Python offers simple method achieving function overloading operators. test this creating special procedures within course. name method begins with underscores. example, .__len__() .__add__(). identifier with same name known dunder, which abbreviation mean underscores __). call appropriate built-in method using object with corresponding dunder methods place, Python delegates behaviour this method. Also, when employ operator with more operands with corresponding dunder technique, Python delegates behaviour method. instance, could expression .__len__() implement behaviour inbuilt function len() function. Additionally could create .__add__() give behaviour operator addition +). This feature allows apply elegantly simple, expressive, concise language Python code just standard objects also custom objects well. What Aspects Java Python Similar? When continue exploring Python, will find numerous similarities Java. However, likely observed some similarities among Java with Python already despite these differences. It's since Python along with Java were both influenced their counterparts programming language. Class-Based Object Orientation Python type-based, object-oriented programming language. major characteristics Java. However, list object-oriented features differs between languages, explain them sufficient detail requires entire tutorial. good thing that deeper into object-oriented programming with Python compared Java understand distinctions Java Python with regard object-oriented programming techniques. also possible read introduction object-oriented programming within Python increase understanding this subject. Operators Operators shared heritage both languages. Many them same both languages. Let's start comparing well-known Python arithmetic operator Java. addition operator (+), multiplication operator (-), division operator, multiple operator, modulo operator serve almost same purpose both languages, except division operator integer-like operands. This also bitwise operators bitwise operators, (|), bitwise operator (&), bitwise operator (^), unary bitwise operator (~), well bitwise shift operators left shift (<<) right shift (>>). access element sequence, Python square bracket syntax []), just with Java's array access. String Formatting Python initially offered string formatting functionality based printf() function family's handling this issue programming language. This very similar Java's string.format(). operator Python performs this function. operator's left-hand side includes format string. right-hand side contain either table positional parameters dictionary with keyed parameters. following session shows some examples: Input: "Hello, %s!" "world" %-style, single argument Output: 'Hello, world!' Input: "The %d." ("answer", %-style, positional Output: 'The answer 78.' Input: "The %(word)s %(value)d." dict(word "answer", value %-style, key-based Output: 'The answer 78.' Python recently adopted other methods formatting strings. .format() string method one. this case, replacement fields marked with curly braces This illustrated "The word value. ".format(word "answer", value 78). string formatted literals since Python 3.6. Let's have variables with scope value word. this case, expression "f". word equals value returns same string.format() example. Control Flow Constructs When comparing Java Python, control flow constructs look similar. Many control flow concepts intuitively familiar. There differences, however. Python while loop very similar Java's. while (word2 input("Please enter word: "END": print(word) print("READY Line line, code fragment copies standard input standard output until equals "End". This line copied. Instead, text "READY" written, followed newline. have probably seen added value operator walrus construct such this. This assignment operator lowest precedence among operators. When assignment expression part larger expression, will often need parentheses around much like Java. Python loop very similar Java each loop. could similar logic code iterating over list with first five Roman numerals. Input: roman_numerals V".split() roman_numerals Output: ['I', 'II', 'III', 'IV', 'V'] Input: numeral roman_numerals: print(numeral) Output: possible find using str.split() great method creating alphabet words. Sometimes, require counter that runs instead. such situation, we'll employ following range(): Input: range(6): print(k) Output: this case, reference value that next requested range each iteration. This value later printed. event that need iterate over array same time need ongoing counter using enumerate(): Input: numeral enumerate("I V".split(), start print(k, numeral) Output: above example shows functionality both preceding examples combined into loop. accompanying counter defaults zero. However, with optional keyword argument begins, specify different value. Python also understand break continue statements. Another control flow construct similar Java's statements. Input: range(3): adjective "not enough" elif adjective "just enough" else: adjective "more than enough" print(f"You have {adjective} items ({n:d})") Output: have enough items have just enough items have more than enough items shown above, Python If... else construct supports Elif keyword. This useful because there plain switch... case statement. Although many code constructs appear similar, there many differences. Python loops exception catch constructs both support else_ parts. context managers, Python also provides that includes statements. When would Python more useful than Java, Why? Most time, will want select programming language suitable meet specific case another programming language different scenario. When comparing Java with Python other programming languages, consider following factors into consideration: Each Java Python both used with success world's most popular web-based applications. Additionally, make Python shell scripting tools. Python's beautiful syntax, accessibility code, large library, vast array other tools allow quick development. It's likely require less than half lines code needed achieve same results than Java. Since standard Python doesn't require linking compile steps, results immediately whenever change code. This also speeds development process. Normal Java execution speeds higher most general-purpose applications than Python. possible expand Python using with relatively effort. certain degree, this reduce variances speed execution. certain applications like analytics, data modelling, machine learning, artificial intelligence, speed which execution performed essential. most popular third-party applications designed this purpose programming language translated into native code. these cases, Python seems best choice.
