next prev open Python Python very strong advanced programming language, perform various tasks functions using Python. such tasks that easily with help Python opening with Python program. this tutorial, going discuss methods ways which open Python. Opening Python Python program open using Python script, this, different libraries. have different methods which will different libraries their functions open given program. going following methods this section open given using Python program: Using Urllib library function Using webbrowser library function Using selenium library function three libraries, have mentioned above, first libraries generally coming pre-installed with latest Python versions. going discuss three methods will Python program each better understand their implementation. Method Using urllib library function Urllib inbuilt Python module that work urls open using Python program. urllib module, various classes functions defined, which help perform various actions using Python program. will urlopen() method importing urllib.request library program, then give inside this function that will open browser device. better understand implementation this method using urlopen(), will example Python program open link through Example Look following Python program where using urlopen() function: Importing urllib request module program import urllib.request Using urlopen() function with webUrl urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.javatpoint.com/python-tutorial') Output: Explanation: have opened 'Python tutorial JavaTpoint' browser giving link inside urlopen() function program. Method Using webbrowser library function: Now, will webbrowser library, which library Python work with web-based content. environment created user using webbrowser module that enables user display various web-based contents Python application itself. Before start working with webbrowser library, should make sure that properly installed system where running Python. And, webbrowser library present system, then install same using following command command prompt device. install webbrowser Now, will start working with webbrowser library open with webbrowser library; will open() function program. better understand implementation this method using webbrowser library opening Python, will example Python program open link through Example Look following Python program: Import webbrowser module program import webbrowser JavaTpoint open browser url= 'https://www.javatpoint.com/python-tutorial' Open using open() function module webbrowser.open_new_tab(url) Output: Explanation: have opened chrome browser system using open_new_tab() function webbrowser module providing link Method Using selenium library function: Selenium library powerful tool provided Python, controlling links browser system through Python program. also open links Python program using selenium library functions. binding selenium library functions Python provides with some very convenient APIs access WebDrivers selenium modules like Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge etc. Installation selenium library Before start working with selenium library, should make sure that selenium library properly installed system where running Python. install selenium library, have following command with installer command prompt terminal: install selenium have successfully installed selenium library system, above. Currently, Python versions that support Selenium library Python 2.7, Python higher versions. Installation drivers: selenium library functions with URLs, also have install drivers provided selenium respective browser. WebDriver package provided selenium interact with browser present system. WebDrivers interacts with remote server browser system using wire protocol common browsers. Here, providing links download drivers some famous browsers using these links; download drivers browser present system. driver Safari: https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/ driver Firefox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases driver Chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads Now, will start working with selenium library open using selenium library functions program. better understand implementation this method using selenium library opening Python, will example Python program open link through Example Look following Python program: Import webdriver from selenium library from selenium import webdriver Importing keys program from webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys Providing path chrome driver driver webdriver.Chrome('C:/Users/Manish/Downloads/chromedriver_win32/chromedriver.exe') Opening get() method driver.get("https://www.javatpoint.com/python-tutorial") Output: Explanation: After importing webdrivers from selenium library, imported keys from webdrivers program. provided path chrome webdriver downloaded using above-given links. Then, with help get() function with driver, have opened browser giving link get() method. using three methods have mentioned this tutorial, easily open inside browser system with help Python program.
