next prev Django Node Difference between Django Node this tutorial, will discuss primary difference between both trending technologies Django Node This tutorial will give deep analysis both technologies that will help select appropriate language projects your career. will explore essential topics advantages, disadvantages, their uses. Both technologies much powerful building various purpose web-applications with excellent user interface. Both open-source, which means anyone them without paid license. Let's have overview each technology which given below. What Django? Django high-level framework that permits user develop secure maintainable websites. written Python programming language. Experienced programmers build Django handles hassle development that users write efficient web-applications. vast active community, excellent documentation, other features. Features Django Django comes with many useful features. Complete Django based "Battery included" approach that allows developer things "out box." provides almost every feature that works seamlessly together follows consistent design principle. user stuck while using he/she take help from up-to-date documentation. Versatile Django versatile framework used develop multi-purpose applications. advantages that easily collaborate with client-side framework bring content almost format. Secure Security main reason popularity Django. provides best security web-application avoids common security mistakes. been engineered "do right things" that automatically protects applications. Django comes with secure manage password; also avoids common mistakes such putting session information cookies where susceptible. Django protects web-applications against many security issues such injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgetting clickjacking. Scalable architecture Django independent others changed replace easily required. different parts Django have clear separation that means increase traffic adding hardware level. Maintainable Django encourages writing maintainable reusable code. follows (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach, will unnecessary duplication. promotes grouping related functionality into reusable application. What Node JS? Node server-side JavaScript platform; intended build scalable network applications developed Ryan Dahl 2009. Node cross-platform runtime environment that used evolving server-side well networking applications. Node consists non-blocking event-driven model that makes lightweight effective. Features Node Below important features Node Asynchronous Event-Driven Node JS's APIs asynchronous event-driven, which means Node bases server doesn't need wait return data. notification mechanism informs server that previous generates response while working API. Speed Node.JS library provides superfast speed execute code built upon Google Chrome's JavaScript engine. Highly Scalable Node.JS highly scalable because uses single-threaded model with event looping. event mechanism allows server respond non-blocking where traditional servers create limited threads handle requests. makes Node.JS highly scalable. Node.JS single thread program provide service large number compared traditional servers such Apache HTTP. Buffering Node.JS application doesn't buffer while processing data. These applications process output data portions. Difference between Django Node.JS Characteristics Django Node Definition Django Python based framework. open-source platform build rich applications. Node open-source application that runs JavaScript designed build powerful APIs (Client-side). Security provides strong security comes with highly protected built-in system which prevents deficiency. secure Django requires manual operations handle security issues. Performance provides much better performance helping create major web-applications. comes with built-in house template system that facilitates execution required task quickly. Node JS's performance quite impressive provide freedom developers. takes much time develop application. Efficiency Django very efficient provides fast speed. cost effective. consumes more operating time. However, easy learn. less cost effective. Architecture follows model template view. works event-driven model. runs operating system maintaining small stack requests. Flexibility This framework less flexible quite strict development features. Node there various tools features available because built upon JavaScript library. Development Speed takes less operating time built-in system; However, time-consuming learn developer doesn't know python. takes more operating time developers experienced with JavaScript then quite helpful. Tool Type framework. runtime environment. Community Django vast community across world up-to-date documentation. also vast community. Architectures Node Django Django Django follows (Model View Template) architecture. provides several advantages over many frameworks. helps developer build apps faster advanced. component-based pattern helps ease modification. change component does affect whole application another component. Node Node architecture quite dissimilar other server-side platforms. based even loop architecture single-threaded that helps build high-end applications. advantage single-threaded that there context switching between that helps reduce reloads. Node handling multiple concurrent requests easy very fast. provides robustness application making them available processing requests without delay. Advantages Disadvantages Django Below important pros cons Django. Advantages provides better security web-application. takes less time complete large projects compared other frameworks. offers better performance level with in-build templates. comparatively easy learn. Disadvantages allows building only single-tiered applications. suitable small apps. requires more understanding framework. Advantages Disadvantages Node Below important pros cons Node Advantages active huge community across world. open-source consists more libraries. easier system follow with less complicated features. execute commands open handily. Conclusion this tutorial, have learned difference between leading technologies Node Django. Moreover, have also discussed various aspects both technologies. Both technologies suitable build large-scale applications apps. Before choosing anyone from them, need understand requirements. Django much secure where maintains passwords effectively Node provides many libraries, which helps developer create highly flexible apps. There specific answer question, "Which technology much better?" need understand project requirements then should move most appropriate technology. Next TopicPython Frameworks prev next
