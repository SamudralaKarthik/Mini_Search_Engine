next prev Python seek() Method Python seek() method used changing current location file handle. file handle like cursor, which used defining location data which read written file. Syntax: fi.seek(offset, from_where), where file pointer Parameters: Offset: This used defining number positions move forward. from_where: This used defining point reference. NOTE: seek() method Python does return value. from_where argument used selecting reference point. accept three values: value used setting whence argument beginning file. value used setting whence argument current position file. value used setting whence argument file. from_where argument default. Therefore, reference point cannot current position position, text mode, except when offset equal Example1: (The user read text file, which contains following text: "This sentence Writing show example seek() method working Python." open("text.txt", "r") second parameter seek method default fi.seek(30) now, will print current position print(fi.tell()) print(fi.readline()) fi.close() Output: show example seek() method working Python. Sample Text File let's assuming text file following lines line This sentence Writing show example seek() method working Python. line line showing second method writing seek() method python Line line showing second method Line line showing second method Line line showing second method Example (method open ("text.txt", "r+") print ("Name file: fi.name) line_1 fi.readline() print ("Read Line: (line_1)) Again, pointer beginning fi.seek line_2 fi.readline() print ("Read Line: (line_2)) Close opend file fi.close() Output: Name file: text.txt Read Line: This sentence Writing show example seek() method working Python. Read Line: line showing second method writing seek() method python seek() method also work with negative offset, only when file opened binary mode. Example (negative offset) open ("text.txt", "rb") user setting reference point thirtieth position left from fi.seek (-70, print current position print (fi.tell()) user will Convert binary string print (fi.readline().decode('utf-8')) fi.close() Output: Writing show example seek() method working Python.
