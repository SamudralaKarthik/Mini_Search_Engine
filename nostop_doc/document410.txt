next prev Readlines Python Readlines function that used Python read particular file line line single very useful reducing time complexity while reading file using brute force approach using loops different iterations. one-line code simple function, which much better than using many loops just reading file. programming, reading file quite tough task, very easy implement this readlines function Python. readlines function reads only complete line from given file; after reading, returns whole line containing elements form list. want open file normal read mode, readline function will return string. want open file binary mode, then readline function will return binary object. also very beneficial appends newline line. This readlines function mostly suitable small-sized files, containing fewer data read whole file within less time easily. first reads file's content memory single then separates them into various lines. With help strip function, iterate over whole list, which been generated readline function, using strip function, strip newline character. Python File concept Python programming language various inbuilt functions writing, creating, reading files. types files handled Python, which normal text files, second binary files mainly written binary language that 1's. Text files: These files contain data form text, which terminated with special character called line line character Python default. Binary files: These types files contain data form binary sequences, consisting mainly 1's. Certain basic steps performed file: Opening file: Opening file done using open function; while using this function, must pass file name Access mode argument. Here file access modes follows: Read-only used read data from file. positioning beginning file. file mentioned present, will generate input/output error. Read-only default mode opening file; while using this mode, cannot edit data file cannot write into file. Write only used write data into file, positioning beginning file. file mentioned present, then will generate input/output error. While using this mode, cannot read data from file. Read Write This mode used writing reading data from file. compare with previous mode, distinguish that cannot write into file read-only mode, read write into file this mode. example, have file named hello.txt want open write mode, then File1 open hello.txt Closing file: Close function used free memory space required file; this method when there longer need file want close entire file want open file different mode. performed using close function, inside this function, required pass argument; this function accessed using file name supplied close function. example, have file named hello.txt want open write mode, then File1 open hello.txt File1.close Writing file: name suggests, easily predict what required write file this method. There ways write file: Write this function, must pass single argument, string want insert into file. example, have file named hello.txt want open write mode, then File1 open hello.txt File1.write Here, string that want insert into file. Writelines this function, must pass array list consisting multiple strings. used insert multiple various strings into file single time. example, have file named hello.txt want open write mode, then File1 open hello.txt File1.writelines( str1 str2 str3 Reading from file: Similarly, this, predict that what have this; even this tutorial, going read among reading methods detail. this method, need read data from particular file. There three ways reading data from file: Read Returns read bytes form string. Reads bytes; specified, then reads entire file. Readline Reads line file returns form string. specified reads most bytes. readline function does read more than line time; even exceeds, reads only line. Readline function reads line file returns string. takes integer value parameter read number characters read time. Readline method very efficient reading data from very large file because fetches data line line returns prints screen. Readline returns next line file, which contains newline character end. Also, file reached, will return empty string. readlines Reads lines returns them string element list. Readlines used read lines single then return them string element list. This function used small files, reads whole file content memory, then splits into separate lines. Using strip function, iterate over list strip newline character using strip function. understand concept reading file detail with help example: Examples reading file Python: Example Reading file using readlines function Python program implement file concept using readlines reading file Fruits ["Apple\n", "Orange\n", "Banana\n"] writing file file open('hello.txt', 'w') file.writelines(Fruits) writelines used write data into file form list, inserting multiple values same time, here, taking hello.txt file file.close() This instruction used close file, i.e., hello.txt Using readlines() file open('hello.txt', 'r') Statements file.readlines() count Strips newline character line Statements: Using loop print data file count count print("Statement{}: {}".format(count, line.strip())) output above example: Example Reading file using readline function Python program implement file concept using readline() reading file Fruit "Apple\n" "Graphs\n" "Mango\n" "Orange\n" "Kiwi\n" Writing file file1 open('new.txt', 'w') file1.writelines((Fruit)) writelines used write data into file form list, inserting multiple values same time, here taking new.txt file file1.close() This instruction used close file, i.e., hello.txt Using readline() file1 open('new.txt', 'r') count while True: count count next line from file file1.readline() line empty file reached break print("Statement{}: {}".format(count, s.strip())) file1.close() output above example: Example Reading file using simple loop: this method, using readline function even using readlines function, have already seen both functions above examples; this method, will loop printing data file. will iterate objects file read file line line, although using some python predefined built-in functions. Using these built-in Python functions, easily iterate over file object implicitly using loop, combination with using iterable object. Python program implement file concept using simple loop reading file Fruits ["Apple \n", Orange \n", "Banana \n", "Mango\n", "Pineapple\n" Writing file file2 open('file2.txt', 'w') file2.writelines(Fruits) writelines used write data into file form list, inserting multiple values same time, here taking file2.txt file file2.close() This instruction used close file, i.e., hello.txt Opening file file2 open('file2.txt', 'r') count Using loop print("Using loop") line file2: count count print("Statement{}: {}".format(count, line.strip())) Closing files file2.close() output above example: Example Reading file using with statement: notice above examples, easily observe that every time whenever file needs open, then required closed; close file, then will create several bugs program because many changes done file come into effect until close file. overcome this problem, will with statement, which mainly used exception handling Python, make code clearer much more readable. Here, this example, easily observe that using file.close function, again again, prevent file, using automatically done with statement. Hence reduces lines code makes program faster implement more efficiently. Python program implement file concept using with statement reading file Veges ["Potato\n", "Onion\n", "Tomamto\n"] Writing file with open("file3.txt", "w") file: file.writelines(Veges) writelines used write data into file form list, inserting multiple values same time, here taking file3.txt file using readlines() count print("Using readlines()") with open("file3.txt") file: Statements file.readlines() line Statements: count count print("Satement{}: {}".format(count, line.strip())) Using readline() count print("\nUsing readline()") with open("file3.txt") file: while True: count count line file.readline() line: break print("Statement{}: {}".format(count, line.strip())) Using loop count print("\n Using loop") with open("file3.txt") file: line file: count count print("Statements{}: {}".format(count, line.strip())) output above example: Next TopicHow Plot Multiple Lines Graph Using Bokeh Python prev next
