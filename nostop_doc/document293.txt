next prev Python Semaphore following tutorial, will understand multi-threading synchronization with help Semaphore Python. begin with understanding Python Semaphore. Understanding Semaphore semaphore synchronization construct. Semaphore offers threads with synchronized access restricted amount resources. semaphore considered variable that reflects amount currently existing resources. instance, there several slots available particular level parking shopping mall that semaphore. semaphore value cannot less than zero greater than total number existing resources. semaphore linked with operations acquire release. When resource among them synchronized using semaphore "acquired" thread, semaphore's value decremented. When resource among them synchronized using semaphore "release" thread, semaphore's value incremented. concept semaphore created Dutch computer scientist named Edsger Dijkstra. operations semaphore, namely acquire release, denoted respectively Dijkstra, where first letters Dutch words proberen vehogen. word proberen represents test, whereas vehogen represents increment Dutch. understand semaphores Python programming language. Understanding Python Semaphores class threading module used implement concept semaphore Python. This class known Semaphore Semaphore class consists constructor, functions, acquire() release(), respectively. acquire() function used decrease count semaphore case count greater than zero. Else blocks till count greater than zero. release() function used increasing count semaphore waking threads waiting semaphore. consider following syntax order create object Semaphore. Syntax: object_name Semaphore(count) Explanation: above syntax, object_name object Semaphore class. 'count' parameter Semaphore class number Threads allowed access simultaneously. default value this parameter Whenever acquire() function executed Thread, value "count" parameter will decremented one. Whenever release() function executed Thread, value "count" parameter will incremented one. This statement implies that whenever call acquire() method, "count" parameter value will decremented, whereas calling release() method, "count" parameter value will incremented. Methods creating Semaphore object Case following case, specify argument within Semaphore class while creating object. Thus, value count variable because which only thread permitted access. This case exact copy Lock concept. syntax same shown below: Syntax: object_name.Semaphore() Case following case, object Semaphore class accessed Threads time. remaining Threads have wait until releasing semaphore. syntax same shown below: Syntax: object_name.Semaphore(n) consider following example understand complete concept properly. Example: importing modules from threading import import time creating thread instance where count my_obj Semaphore(4) creating instance show(the_name): calling acquire method my_obj.acquire() range(6): print('Javatpoint, time.sleep(1) print(the_name) calling release method my_obj.release() creating multiple thread thread_1 Thread(target show args ('Thread 1',)) thread_2 Thread(target show args ('Thread 2',)) thread_3 Thread(target show args ('Thread 3',)) thread_4 Thread(target show args ('Thread 4',)) thread_5 Thread(target show args ('Thread 5',)) thread_6 Thread(target show args ('Thread 6',)) calling threads thread_1.start() thread_2.start() thread_3.start() thread_4.start() thread_5.start() thread_6.start() Output Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Thread Thread Thread Thread Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Thread Thread Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Thread Thread Thread Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Thread Thread Thread Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Thread Thread Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Thread Thread Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Thread Thread Javatpoint, Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Thread Javatpoint, Thread Thread Thread Thread Javatpoint, Thread Thread Thread Explanation: above snippet code, have imported required modules created object Semaphore class with count value have then defined function using acquire() function object. have then used for-loop iterate value have then called release() function created multiple threads. last, have called threads using start() function.
