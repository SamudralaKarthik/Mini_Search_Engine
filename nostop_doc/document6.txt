next prev Python Variables Variable name that used refer memory location. Python variable also known identifier used hold value. Python, don't need specify type variable because Python infer language smart enough variable type. Variable names group both letters digits, they have begin with letter underscore. recommended lowercase letters variable name. Rahul rahul both different variables. Identifier Naming Variables example identifiers. Identifier used identify literals used program. rules name identifier given below. first character variable must alphabet underscore characters except first character alphabet lower-case(a-z), upper-case (A-Z), underscore, digit (0-9). Identifier name must contain white-space, special character (!, *). Identifier name must similar keyword defined language. Identifier names case sensitive; example, name, MyName same. Examples valid identifiers: a123, _n, n_9, etc. Examples invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, etc. Declaring Variable Assigning Values Python does bind declare variable before using application. allows create variable required time. don't need declare explicitly variable Python. When assign value variable, that variable declared automatically. equal operator used assign value variable. Object References necessary understand Python interpreter works when declare variable. process treating variables somewhat different from many other programming languages. Python highly object-oriented programming language; that's every data item belongs specific type class. Consider following example. print("John") Output: John Python object creates integer object displays console. above print statement, have created string object. Let's check type using Python built-in type() function. type("John") Output: <class 'str'> Python, variables symbolic name that reference pointer object. variables used denote objects that name. Let's understand following example above image, variable refers integer object. Suppose assign integer value variable variable refers same object that points because Python does create another object. Let's assign value both variables will refer different objects. =100 Python manages memory efficiently assign same variable different values. Object Identity Python, every created object identifies uniquely Python. Python provides guaranteed that objects will have same identifier. built-in id() function, used identify object identifier. Consider following example. print(id(a)) print(id(b)) Reassigned variable print(id(a)) Output: 140734982691168 140734982691168 2822056960944 assigned both point same object. When checked id() function returned same number. reassign 500; then referred object identifier. Variable Names have already discussed declare valid variable. Variable names length have uppercase, lowercase z), digit (0-9), underscore character(_). Consider following example valid variables names. name "Devansh" marks 80.50 print(name) print(age) print(marks) Output: Devansh 80.5 Consider following valid variables name. name Name naMe NAME "D" n_a_m_e _name name_ _name_ "H" na56me print(name,Name,naMe,NAME,n_a_m_e, NAME, n_a_m_e, _name, name_,_name, na56me) Output: above example, have declared valid variable names such name, _name_ etc. recommended because when read code, create confusion. variable name should descriptive make code more readable. multi-word keywords created following method. Camel Case camel case, each word abbreviation middle begins with capital letter. There intervention whitespace. example nameOfStudent, valueOfVaraible, etc. Pascal Case same Camel Case, here first word also capital. example NameOfStudent, etc. Snake Case snake case, Words separated underscore. example name_of_student, etc. Multiple Assignment Python allows assign value multiple variables single statement, which also known multiple assignments. apply multiple assignments ways, either assigning single value multiple variables assigning multiple values multiple variables. Consider following example. Assigning single value multiple variables x=y=z=50 print(x) print(y) print(z) Output: Assigning multiple values multiple variables: a,b,c=5,10,15 print print print Output: values will assigned order which variables appear. Python Variable Types There types variables Python Local variable Global variable. Let's understand following variables. Local Variable Local variables variables that declared inside function have scope within function. Let's understand following example. Example Declaring function add(): Defining local variables. They scope only within function print("The is:", Calling function add() Output: Explanation: above code, declared function named add() assigned variables within function. These variables will referred local variables which have scope only inside function. them outside function, following error. add() Accessing local variable outside function print(a) Output: print(a) NameError: name defined tried local variable outside their scope; threw NameError. Global Variables Global variables used throughout program, scope entire program. global variables inside outside function. variable declared outside function global variable default. Python provides global keyword global variable inside function. don't global keyword, function treats local variable. Let's understand following example. Example Declare variable initialize Global variable function mainFunction(): printing global variable global print(x) modifying global variable 'Welcome Javatpoint' print(x) mainFunction() print(x) Output: Welcome Javatpoint Welcome Javatpoint Explanation: above code, declare global variable assign value Next, defined function accessed declared variable using global keyword inside function. modify value. Then, assigned string value variable Now, called function proceeded print printed newly assigned value Delete variable delete variable using keyword. syntax given below. Syntax <variable_name> following example, create variable assign value deleted variable print error "variable defined". variable will longer future. Example Assigning value print(x) deleting variable. print(x) Output: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:/Users/DEVANSH SHARMA/PycharmProjects/Hello/multiprocessing.py", line 389, print(x) NameError: name defined Maximum Possible Value Integer Python Unlike other programming languages, Python doesn't have long float data types. treats integer values data type. Here, question arises. What maximum possible value hold variable Python? Consider following example. Example Python program display that store large numbers Python 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 print(type(a)) print Output: <class 'int'> 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 above example, assigned large integer value variable checked type. printed class <int> long int. Hence, there limitation number bits expand limit memory. Python doesn't have special data type store larger numbers. Print Single Multiple Variables Python print multiple variables within single print statement. Below example single multiple printing values. Example (Printing Single Variable) printing single value print(a) print((a)) Output: Example (Printing Multiple Variables) printing multiple variables print(a,b) separate variables comma Print(1, Output: Basic Fundamentals: This section contains fundamentals Python, such i)Tokens their types. Comments a)Tokens: tokens defined punctuator mark, reserved words, each word statement. token smallest unit inside given program. There following tokens Python: Keywords. Identifiers. Literals.
