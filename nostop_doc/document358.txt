Retrieving Historical Market Prices: even retrieve historical market prices from Yahoo financial data, then even print this information output. Example Let's first look following example, then will understand more about retrieving historical market prices: Import yfinance module import yfinance yahooFin Using ticker Facebook yfinance function retrFBInfo yahooFin.Ticker("FB") Initializing variable retrieving market prices maxHisMP retrFBInfo.history(period="max") Printing historical market prices output print("Historical Market Prices data from Facebook page financial data Yahoo: print(maxHisMP) Output: Historical Market Prices data from Facebook page financial data Yahoo: Open High Close Volume Date 2012-05-18 42.049999 45.000000 38.000000 38.230000 573576400 2012-05-21 36.529999 36.660000 33.000000 34.029999 168192700 2012-05-22 32.610001 33.590000 30.940001 31.000000 101786600 2012-05-23 31.370001 32.500000 31.360001 32.000000 73600000 2012-05-24 32.950001 33.209999 31.770000 33.029999 50237200 2021-10-04 335.529999 335.940002 322.700012 326.230011 42885000 2021-10-05 328.579987 335.179993 326.160004 332.959991 35377900 2021-10-06 329.739990 334.380005 325.799988 333.640015 26443000 2021-10-07 337.000000 338.839996 328.980011 329.220001 28307500 2021-10-08 331.510010 333.399994 328.709991 330.049988 15934300 Dividends Stock Splits Date 2012-05-18 2012-05-21 2012-05-22 2012-05-23 2012-05-24 2021-10-04 2021-10-05 2021-10-06 2021-10-07 2021-10-08 [2364 rows columns] Explanation: this example, have imported historical market prices from Facebook's financial data from Yahoo page retrieved program. have retrieved historical market prices from Facebook's financial data using history() function with Ticker, then have stored information inside variable have initialized, i.e., maxHisMP. last, have printed this historical market prices information output result program. information regarding history market prices maximum period available Yahoo financial data. Note: 'max' have defined history function with ticker used collect history market prices available maximum time period Yahoo. keyword will retrieve history daily price changes Facebook available Yahoo. Now, have learned that bring history market prices from Yahoo's financial data using history() function. here thing that even minimize data which getting from history() reduce complexity. this giving fixed time argument inside history() function retrieve only small amount data from Yahoo. Here, going perform this function ways which following: Collecting fixed time data since Last day' '5 day' month' '3 month' etc., providing fixed time argument inside history function. Let's understand this using fixed time argument inside program then retrieving market prices from Yahoo. Example Look following Python program where will retrieve last month's history market prices from Facebook: Import yfinance module import yfinance yahooFin Using ticker Facebook yfinance function retrFBInfo yahooFin.Ticker("FB") Initializing variable retrieving market prices his3MonMP retrFBInfo.history(period="3mo") Printing historical market prices output print("Historical Market Prices data last months from Facebook page Yahoo: print(his3MonMP) Output: Historical Market Prices data last months from Facebook page Yahoo: Open High Close Volume Date 2021-07-09 345.320007 350.709991 345.269989 350.420013 13018700 2021-07-12 351.230011 354.190002 349.640015 353.160004 10018600 2021-07-13 351.500000 358.489990 348.799988 352.089996 11456000 2021-07-14 354.559998 355.200012 346.730011 347.630005 13894200 2021-07-15 349.230011 349.230011 340.220001 344.459991 14781600 2021-10-04 335.529999 335.940002 322.700012 326.230011 42885000 2021-10-05 328.579987 335.179993 326.160004 332.959991 35377900 2021-10-06 329.739990 334.380005 325.799988 333.640015 26443000 2021-10-07 337.000000 338.839996 328.980011 329.220001 28307500 2021-10-08 331.510010 333.399994 328.709991 330.049988 15934300 Dividends Stock Splits Date 2021-07-09 2021-07-12 2021-07-13 2021-07-14 2021-07-15 2021-10-04 2021-10-05 2021-10-06 2021-10-07 2021-10-08 [65 rows columns] Explanation: have used same logic have used previous example program collected data historical market prices from Facebook page Yahoo. But, this program, instead collecting maximum data, have limited data giving argument '3mo' inside history function that will only retrieve history market prices last three months only. then, printed this last three months market prices history output result. output, history market prices Facebook page Yahoo since only last three months have been printed. Note: When have collect data from past fixed time, then cannot give duration argument history function because will valid argument. have following valid fixed time period arguments history function yfinance module: max, ytd, 10y, 5y, 2y, 1y, 6mo, 3mo, 1mo, 1d. cannot give other time period argument inside history() function will treated invalid argument, data market prices history will retrieved. Collecting fixed data from history() function giving start time time arguments this history() function. retrieve data time period which want defining starting time variables then using these variables arguments history() function. Let's understand this using these defined time arguments inside program then retrieving market prices history from Yahoo. Example Look following Python program where will retrieve history market prices from Facebook user defined period time: Import yfinance module import yfinance yahooFin Importing datetime module program import datetime Using ticker Facebook yfinance function retrFBInfo yahooFin.Ticker("FB") Define start date variable strtDate datetime.datetime(2021, Define date variable endDate datetime.datetime(2021, Initializing variable retrieving market prices fixTimeMP retrFBInfo.history(start strtDate, endDate) Printing historical market prices output print("Historical Market Prices data time period defined from financial data Facebook page: print(fixTimeMP) Output: Historical Market Prices data time period defined from financial data Facebook page: Open High Close Volume Date 2021-04-26 303.339996 305.799988 301.559998 303.040009 16172600 2021-04-27 304.279999 305.339996 301.109985 303.570007 15309300 2021-04-28 307.359985 310.920013 305.369995 307.100006 33907200 2021-04-29 330.119995 331.809998 321.609985 329.510010 56526800 2021-04-30 326.140015 329.820007 324.500000 325.079987 26332400 2021-07-30 354.000000 360.730011 352.940002 356.299988 15966700 2021-08-02 358.100006 359.399994 350.739990 351.950012 13180400 2021-08-03 352.730011 353.769989 347.700012 351.239990 12406100 2021-08-04 352.420013 360.480011 351.510010 358.920013 14180600 2021-08-05 359.640015 363.899994 356.899994 362.970001 10247200 Dividends Stock Splits Date 2021-04-26 2021-04-27 2021-04-28 2021-04-29 2021-04-30 2021-07-30 2021-08-02 2021-08-03 2021-08-04 2021-08-05 [72 rows columns] Explanation: have imported yfinance well datetime module this program that datetime() function Then, defined variables where start dates them using datetime function datetime module. Then, used these variables inside history() function start date retrieving data from Yahoo. have used start keyword inside history() starting date ending date collecting data. That's will retrieve user fixed time's market prices history from Yahoo. last, have printed minimized data output result. output that have fixed time (which program) history market prices from Yahoo.
