next prev Python Program Calculating Squares First Natural Numbers this tutorial, will learn calculate squares first natural numbers using Python. have positive integer "N", task calculate +â€¦ N2) Example: Input: Output: +36 Input: Output: Method O(N) this method, user loop from natural number, each user find K2 calculate sum. Example: First, will create function which will return squares first "NN" natural numbers square_sum(NN) here, will iterate from finding square numbers from then sum. sum_1 range(1, sum_1 sum_1 return sum_1 Driven Program (input ("Please enter natural number: print (square_sum(NN) Output: Please enter natural number: 60116 Method O(1) this method, user calculate square first natural numbers using following formula: Example: sum_1 			= (13)) 			= (546) 			= sum_1 (57) (113)) (3,60,696) 60116 Code: First, will create function which will return squares first "NN" natural numbers square_sum(NN) return Driven Program int( input("Please enter natural number: print (square_sum(NN)) Output: Please enter natural number: 223300 Avoid Early Overflow: large "NN" natural number, value [(NN would probably overflow. users avoid this situation using fact that must divisible Example: First, will create function which will return squares first "NN" natural numbers square_sum(NN): return Driven Program int( input("Please enter natural number: print (square_sum(NN)) Output: Please enter natural number: 121844520 Conclusion this tutorial, have explained methods calculating squares natural numbers using python avoiding code's overflow.
