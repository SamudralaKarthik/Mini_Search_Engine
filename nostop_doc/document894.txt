next OpenCV Tutorial OpenCV using Python OpenCV tutorial provides basic advanced concepts OpenCV. OpenCV tutorial designed beginners professionals. OpenCV open-source library computer vision. provides facility machine recognize faces objects. this tutorial will learn concept OpenCV using Python programming language. OpenCV tutorial includes topics Read Save Image, Canny Edge Detection, Template matching, Blob Detection, Contour, Mouse Event, Gaussian blur What OpenCV? OpenCV Python open-source library, which used computer vision Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, face recognition, etc. OpenCV, abbreviation form computer vision, which defined field study that helps computers understand content digital images such photographs videos. purpose computer vision understand content images. extracts description from pictures, which object, text description, three-dimension model, example, cars facilitated with computer vision, which will able identify different objects around road, such traffic lights, pedestrians, traffic signs, acts accordingly. Computer vision allows computer perform same kind tasks humans with same efficiency. There main task which defined below: Object Classification object classification, train model dataset particular objects, model classifies objects belonging more your training categories. Object Identification object identification, model will identify particular instance object example, parsing faces image tagging Virat Kohli other Rohit Sharma. History OpenCV stands Open Source Computer Vision Library, which widely used image recognition identification. officially launched 1999 Intel. written C/C++ early stage, commonly used Python computer vision well. first alpha version OpenCV released common IEEE Conference Computer Vision Pattern Recognition 2000, between 2001 2005, five betas were released. first version released 2006. second version OpenCV released October 2009 with significant changes. second version contains major change interface, aiming easier, more type-safe, pattern, better implementations. Currently, development done independent Russian team releases newer version every months. OpenCV Works this tutorial, will learn computers perform image recognition. does computer recognize image? Human eyes provide lots information based what they see. Machines facilitated with seeing everything, convert vision into numbers store memory. Here question arises computer convert images into numbers. answer that pixel value used convert images into numbers. pixel smallest unit digital image graphics that displayed represented digital display device. picture intensity particular location represented numbers. above image, have shown pixel values grayscale image consist only value, intensity black color that location. There common ways identify images: Grayscale Grayscale images those images which contain only colors black white. contrast measurement intensity black treated weakest intensity, white strongest intensity. When grayscale image, computer assigns each pixel value based level darkness. combination red, green, blue color which together makes color. computer retrieves that value from each pixel puts results array interpreted. OpenCV used Computer Vision? OpenCV available free cost. Since OpenCV library written C/C++, quit fast. used with Python. require less usage, maybe 60-70 Computer Vision portable OpenCV device that Prerequisite Before learning OpenCV, must have basic knowledge Python programming language.
