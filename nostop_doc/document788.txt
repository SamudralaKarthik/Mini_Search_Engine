I'll also look relationships among group Twitter users based mentions followers. Social media analytics topic data science. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, other social media apps consume most time. Because everyone familiar with this world, these analyses pique people's interest. majority relationship analysis tasks make social media analysis. addition using Python scrape Twitter, will conduct relationship analysis using data scraped. Using Python Scrape Twitter let's started project. need install package called twint complete this task scraping Twitter with Python. Installing twint simple with terminal command install twine. Let's import necessary packages begin task scraping Twitter with Python: have installed this library. Snippet code: import twint import pandas from collections import Counter Code language: JavaScript (javascript) must begin making user list Twitter accounts after importing required libraries. We'll examine connections between these individuals' Twitter accounts, which I'll list below: Snippet code: users 'shakira', 'KimKardashian', 'rihanna', 'jtimberlake', 'King-kJames', 'neymarjr', Code language: JavaScript (javascript) make analysis more fascinating, I've selected well-known Twitter users that everyone familiar with. Python Twitter Scraping Relationship Analysis Let's start using Python scrape Twitter, I'll create function called followings that calls twins library with username study connections between every Twitter account list above. list people that input customers follows will returned this function. Snippet code: get_followings(username): twint.Config() c.Username username c.Pandas True twint.run.Following(c) list_of_followings twint.storage.panda.Follow_df return list_of_followings['following'][username] Code language: (php) Since occasionally index error when Twitter does answer request, loop below will produce variables. avoid these users these situations, added exception code: Snippet code: followings following_list__ person users: print('#####\nStarting: person '\n#####') try: followings[person] get_followings(person) following_list__ following_list__ followings[person] except KeyError: print('IndexError') Code language: (php) simply calculate list variable's most frequent values after obtaining following lists determine which accounts most well-liked users. will make Counter function collection library obtain most followed accounts: Snippet code: Counter(following_list__).most_common(10) Code language: (CSS) What want know user group being followed? research created loop that determines which users following list other people. consequence, generates list dictionary that shows states denoted True False each following: Snippet code: follow_relations following_user followings.keys(): p1follow_relation_list__ followed_user_ followings.keys(): followed_user_ followings[following_user]: p1follow_relation_list__.append(True) else: p1follow_relation_list__.append(False) follow_relations[following_user] p1follow_relation_list__ Code language: (php) resulting dictionary converted into pandas dataframe code below more approachable representation. dataframe's rows display users being followed, while columns display opposite: Snippet code: following_df pd.DataFrame.from_dict(follow_relations, orient='index', columns=followings.keys()) following_df Code language: JavaScript (javascript) Expected Output: results analysis displayed above. this table, confirm Rihana's popularity. Each other follows order. can't speak same language about Kim Kardashians, though, because only Justin Timberlake's account users list follows her, data. Complete code: import twint import pandas from collections import Counter Code language: JavaScript (javascript) users 'shakira', 'KimKardashian', 'rihanna', 'jtimberlake', 'King-kJames', 'neymarjr', Code language: JavaScript (javascript) get_followings(username): twint.Config() c.Username username c.Pandas True twint.run.Following(c) list_of_followings twint.storage.panda.Follow_df return list_of_followings['following'][username] Code language: (php) followings following_list__ person users: print('#####\nStarting: person '\n#####') try: followings[person] get_followings(person) following_list__ following_list__ followings[person] except KeyError: print('IndexError') Code language: (php) Counter(following_list__).most_common(10) Code language: (css) follow_relations following_user followings.keys(): p1follow_relation_list__ followed_user_ followings.keys(): followed_user_ followings[following_user]: p1follow_relation_list__.append(True) else: p1follow_relation_list__.append(False) follow_relations[following_user] p1follow_relation_list__ Code language: (php) following_df pd.DataFrame.from_dict(follow_relations, orient='index', columns=followings.keys()) following_df Code language: JavaScript (javascript) Card Game with Python We'll show Python create card game this Tutorial. will construct this card game defining classes representing player, deck, game itself_. Each player picks card from deck in-game, user with high number cards wins. Card Game with Python: Class Card Below python class that builds game playing cards: Snippet code: Class Card: suits_ ["spades-s", "hearts-s", "diamonds-d", "clubs-c"] values [None, None,"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack-j", "Queen-q", "King-k", "Ace-A"] __init__(self_, s1): """suit_+ value ints""" self_.value self_.suit_= __lt__(self_, c22): self_.value c22.value: return True self_.value c22.value: self_.suit_< c22.suit: return True else: return False return False __gt__(self_, c22): self_.value c22.value: return True self_.value c22.value: self_.suit_> c22.suit: return True else: return False return False __repr__(self_): self_.values[self_.value] self_.suits_[self_.suit] return Card class first class Python card game, class variables: values suits_.Suits_ collection strings that represents possible suits_ card:clubs-c, hearts-s, spades-s, diamonds-dvalue collection strings that represent various numerical values that card have:2-10, Ace-A, Jack-j, Queen-q, King-k. string tuple matches value index they represent because elements first indexes None. result, value tuple contains string index There instance variables card items: each represented integer, suit, value. Card object's card type represented instance variables taken whole. creating Card object passing parameters (for color) create "2 hearts-s." These magic techniques' codes also determine whether cards have same value, like both cards have value methods combinations' values break tie this occurs. Card Game with Python: Class Deck represent deck cards, next, need define python class: Snippet code: From random import shuffle class Deck: __init__(self_): self_.cards range(2, 15): range(4): self_.cards\ .append(Card(i, shuffle(self_.cards) rm_card(self_): len(self_.cards) return return self_.cards.pop() loops __init__ produce Card items representing every card 52-card deck them card list when initialize Deck object. Because card's starting value last value first loop ranges from (the ace-A). From outside loop, integer used value ace-A), from inside loop used suit construct card each trip around inside loop. Fifty-two cards produced this process, each possible pairing suit value. Card playing Game Python: Class Player keep track each player's cards number tricks won, need python class show each players: Snippet code: Class Player: __init__(self_, name): self_.wins self_.card None self_.name name Three instance variables make Player python class: wins track many number turns user got, card represent card they currently hold, name record their names. Card Game with Python: Class Game represent actual real game finally, will define python class Snippet code: class Game: __init__(self_): name_1 input("p11 name name_2 input("p22 name self_.deck Deck() self_.p11 Player(name_1) self_.p22 Player(name_2) wins(self_, winsides): wins this round" w1.format(winsides) print(w1) draw(self_, p11, p11, p22, p22c): drew drew d1.format(p11, p11, p22, p22c) print(d1) play_game(self_): cards self_.deck.cards print("beginning War!") while len(cards) quit. "key play:" response input(m) response 'q': break self_.deck.rm_card() p22c self_.deck.rm_card() self_.p1.name self_.p22.name self_.draw(p11, p11, p22, p22c) p22c: self_.p1.wins self_.wins(self_.p1.name) else: self_.p22.wins self_.wins(self_.p22.name) self_.winsides(self_.p11, self_.p22) print("War over.{} wins" .format(win)) winsides(self_, p11, p22): p11.wins p22.wins: return p1.name p11.wins p22.wins: return p22.name return tie!" Python calls __init__ method when game object created, input function stores names players game variables name_1 name_2. Then, using names name_1 name_2, create Player objects store them instance variable deck. game launched Game class's play__game method. method loop that keeps game going long more cards deck variable response doesn't equal play__game method assigns 1ST card second each draw loop. Then assign response variable player's input each loop turn. game will continue until player types "q" deck runs cards. then prints name each player card drew, determines which card bigger comparing two, increases gets points instance variable user with highest card, prints message announcing won. Game class also winning method that returns player with most tricks. takes player items, looks many tricks they've won, play__game method calls winning function (sending both p22) displays text with output-the player won-when Deck object runs cards.
