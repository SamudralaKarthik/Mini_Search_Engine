next prev Complete roadmap learn Python Python most popular fastest-growing programming languages world. Python programming language that utilized many different things. Python develop apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, test software, even hacking. It's great programming language people just beginner. you're starting, might know what first. Should read book look online tutorial learn everything need know? let's discuss everything need become Python developer. before starting, let's first understand different usage Python: Python language People from different fields Python wide range tasks, such data analysis, visualization, automation, developing Machine Learning apps, etc. Python syntax scripts perform many repetitive tasks automatically, such copying required folders files, renaming requirement, submitting them server. used mathematicians, accountants, data analysts, network engineers, scientists, too, just software engineers. above points show Python most popular programming language need learn questions are, "From where begin with Python?". much time required learn Python language? Python? What should learn about when study Python? What libraries frameworks Python? let's find answer these questions. Python? (Figure your final goal) Before start working with Python, should know what want accomplish. question below start learning Python. What makes want learn Python? What planning with this language? need robotize some boring repetitive tasks? want make some apps? Most people just starting learn language make same mistake: they don't have goal mind when they start. Remember that learning language using build something useful real world different things. Your goal should just learn language. Instead, should able build things. first, look into each python topic decide what you're most interested Here, already talked about different ways Python used. first, decide what want build. Once what want build, stay with work next step, which find materials. Tools Learning There information videos about Python online, difficult know where begin learning especially since used many different technologies. Understand that single video course tutorial, book can't teach detail need know about Python. beginner, also feel overwhelmed number concepts, have patience, explore, stick with Here some places start learning Python that have found, make sure that whichever place choose also your code. already know programming, development, basic syntax, read official documentation Python Tutorial JavaTpoint website learn. Click here. also online text tutorials, video tutorials, online/offline courses, most them start beginning, which waste time. depends your skill much experience programming already have. just beginning with Python language like reading original documentation, refer online course that covers everything. Time Learning Choose date finish course, matter what resources use. beginner learn hours every day, finish course 10-11 weeks. Now, let's move next step look important Python topics should learn about. Keep mind that there learn, once done with topics, start learning more about Python language your own. Python's most important topics Learn fundamentals syntax First, make sure that Python your system. Just Python's official website download latest version. Once installation done, write Python code with IDE. Now, will over some topics help started with learning Python. will take almost full week half week cover basics, depends learn. These basic topics included Python shell simple math. Control structures. Taking input from user, Strings, Typecasting. Python ways make loops: while. Taking care errors. Functions, modules Imports. OOPs concepts, data structures, Python things This topic will hard don't have idea about object-oriented programming. some top-rated resources, with little practice, you'll able understand ideas. These ideas will used making complex applications, should know about them. might take week learn. Programming with objects Python Lists List functions Regular Expressions List comprehension list slicing function Formatting string Lambdas List, Definitions, Pairs Once you've mastered above topics spent enough time practicing each one, it's time them together make something. Python large number modules, packages, libraries, frameworks that used many different tasks. instead developing application from scratch, python language's frameworks libraries. relative frameworks libraries, becomes easier build application understand development procedure. Choose framework library based requirement development, desktop-based applications, personal choice. Frameworks application development Python different frameworks building apps. Some these Django, Bottle, Flask, Tornado, Pyramid. Django Django high-level framework that most startups businesses build websites. Django framework uses pattern with database support. several databases understanding requirement, example, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle. complete beginner, then will have hard time learning Django. beginners don't know Django terms like page authentication, API, routing, models. Take your time, patient, look some more resources, read each line code until understand You'll figure everything slowly gradually. Learning Django framework features take weeks. Flask Flask Python microframeworks that easiest learn. Flask good choice want make simple, lightweight application. isn't powerful Django, still features like support unit testing ability build REST APIs. Learning Flask will take weeks. Desktop Applications Libraries Desktop applications built using Python Libraries like Tkinter, PyQT, Kivy, WxPython, PyGUI great making desktop applications. Tkinter Tkinter open-source library that lets Python make desktop programs. Tkinter easy learn graphical interface. Tkinter will take about week learn. PyQT Nokia owns PyQt, which most powerful libraries with cross-platform features. uses both Python programming language library. used make GUIs desktop applications. Kivy Kivy used make desktop apps, also works Android, iOS, Linux, Raspberry Data Analysis libraries such Pandas, Bokeh, SciPy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn good analyzing data. People want become data analysts data scientists will find these libraries useful. will take about week learn Numpy Pandas. Numpy Numpy package processing arrays. comes with fast array object. used scientific computing with Python, features that important data analysis. Pandas Pandas another great open-source library analyzing data. gives high-level data structures (like DataFrame) huge number tools analyzing data. also turn complicated tasks simple just commands. Using this library makes much easier change data. Machine Learning Machine learning uses following standard libraries Python operations development process. TensorFlow Google's TensorFlow most well-known deep learning library. computers describe algorithms that Tensor operations. Scikit-Learn Python Scikit-Learn essential library machine learning that made work with numerical libraries like SciPy NumPy. PyTorch PyTorch handle computation graphs that change they being used. also that easy use. Make things. far, we've gone over almost everything there know about Python. last step build projects. can't build anything with Python, doesn't matter much know about Remember that working complicated project that solves problem best test your programming skills. Building project hard first-time builder, start with something small. Start with something easy then work your want make complicated project, should start with small, simple module keep adding Projects great improve your skills. When you're working project, you'll into frustration, challenges, other problems. When solve these problems, learn many useful skills. Getting through these challenges gives enough practice using Python solve problems. able maintain your progress along with your project development learn programmers solve hard problems real world. Python make different things. make simple projects like simple interest/EMI calculator, simple weather app, simple crawler. discussing complicated projects, then develop functional e-commerce site application. refer Web-based crawler that dynamically crawls specific webpage. Another project option Online generator that turns input text into Tips: Have patience. Learning first language always takes more time work, know that will take while everything sink This true only when learning Python also when learning language. Keep your goal language mind. Don't just learn syntax language also then move another. Frustration pain important parts learning, don't avoid them. want give because some hard words, mistakes, other problems. Don't back out; it's something that every programmer deal with. Take some time learn about subject using something else clear mind. consistent with your learning. aren't consistent, learning will take more time effort. Putting together project always good build confidence, don't forget important Conclusion roadmap Python language learning helps students, fresher, learners. uses know learn python language professional purposes creaking applications. know about Python frameworks, libraries, technologies, other necessary things.
