next prev Python module following tutorial, will understand module Python programming language. will also perform some examples based Python module. let's begun. Understanding module Python media player open-source free media player software that portable used multiple platforms. media player also stream media server designed developed VideoLAN project. media player available desktop operating systems, like Windows, Linux, MacOS, well mobile platforms, like Android, iOS, iPadOS, Windows mobile, Windows Phone, Tizen. utilize media player with help Python well. Python offers supported module known VLC. install module? order install module Python, will installer following command shown below: Syntax: install python-vlc Note: media player must installed user system before using module Python. Once installation completed, verify importing module into Python script. consider following syntax same: Syntax: importing module import Now, have save file program does raise error, module installed properly. However, not, recommended reinstall module read official documentation more details. Fixing errors that occur while importing module case path defined, issue that PATH (System Variable). have include libvlc.dll file path system variable solve problem. find this file folder where installed. Wrong version VLC: Generally, users install bits version VLC, which cause some trouble have installed bits version Python. have reinstall bits version order this. import module before module register using following syntax: Syntax: os.add_dll_directory(r'C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC') Some examples module consider simple program play Video using VLC. Example: importing module import creating media player object my_media vlc.MediaPlayer("video.mp4") playing video my_media.play() Explanation: above snippet code, have imported module. have then created object media player. last, have used play() function order play video. Now, consider another example deriving duration video file using module. Example: importing time modules import time, defining method play video vlc_video(src): creating instance vlc_obj vlc.Instance() creating media player vlcplayer vlc_obj.media_player_new() creating media vlcmedia vlc_obj.media_new(src) setting media player vlcplayer.set_media(vlcmedia) playing video vlcplayer.play() waiting time time.sleep(0.5) getting duration video video_duration vlcplayer.get_length() printing duration video print("Duration str(video_duration)) calling video method vlc_video("video.mp4") Output: Duration 465351 Explanation: above snippet code, have imported time module. have then defined function play video. Within function, have created instance media player. have then created media player. have then played video waiting time 0.5. have then stored duration video printed users. last, have called defined function.
