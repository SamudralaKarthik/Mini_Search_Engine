next prev Remove Duplicates from list Python When element occurs more than once list, refer duplicate. this tutorial, will learn different methods removing these duplicates from list Python. Basic Approach Using List Comprehension Using Set() Using enumerate() Using OrderedDict discuss each them detail. Basic Approach first method, will discuss basic approach removing duplicates from list using Python. #initializing list list_value1=[12,15,11,12,8,15,3,3] print("The initialized list ",list_value1) res_list=[] list_value1: res_list: res_list.append(i) #printing list after removing duplicate elements print("The resultant list after removing duplicates ",res_list) Output: initialized list [12, resultant list after removing duplicates [12, Explanation it's time have glance explanation above program. first step initialize list that contains duplicate values. After this, have printed this list that becomes easy compare lists output. next step, have declared empty list that will hold unique values then used loop followed decision making check whether particular element exists list not, doesn't exist, will append list. Finally, have displayed resultant list. second program, will make list comprehension meet objective. Using List Comprehension following program illustrates same- #initializing list list_value1=[12,15,11,12,8,15,3,3] print("The initialized list ",list_value1) res_list=[] #using list comprehension [res_list.append(i) list_value1 res_list] #printing list after removing duplicate elements print("The resultant list after removing duplicates ",res_list) Output: initialized list [12, resultant list after removing duplicates [12, Explanation Let's understand what have done above program- first step initialize list that contains duplicate values. After this, have printed this list that becomes easy compare lists output. next step, have used list comprehension build same logic. Finally, have displayed resultant list. third approach, will set() used obtain list distinct elements. Using Set() program given below shows done- #initializing list list_value1 [12,15,11,12,8,15,3,3] print("The initialized list ",list_value1) res_list #using set() list_value1 list(set(list_value1)) #printing list after removing duplicate elements print("The resultant list after removing duplicates ",list_value1) Output: initialized list [12, resultant list after removing duplicates [12, Explanation Let's understand what happened here, first step initialize list that contains duplicate values. After this, have printed this list that becomes easy compare lists output. next step, have used set() inside list() passed list_value1 parameter that obtain list distinct elements. Finally, have displayed resultant list. Using enumerate() let's enumerate() used meet objective. following program illustrates same- #initializing list list_value1 [12,15,11,12,8,15,3,3] print("The initialized list ",list_value1) res_list n,x enumerate(list_value1) list_value1[:n]] #printing list after removing duplicate elements print("The resultant list after removing duplicates ",res_list) Output: initialized list [12, resultant list after removing duplicates [12, Explanation first step initialize list that contains duplicate values. After this, have printed this list that becomes easy compare lists output. next step, have used enumerate() inside list comprehension that will return list containing unique elements. Finally, have displayed resultant list. Finally, last program will OrderedDict used remove duplicates from list using Python. Using OrderedDict program given below shows done- from collections import OrderedDict #initializing list list_value1 [12,15,11,12,8,15,3,3] print("The initialized list ",list_value1) #using OrderedDict res_list list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(list_value1)) #printing list after removing duplicate elements print("The resultant list after removing duplicates ",res_list) Output: initialized list [12, resultant list after removing duplicates [12, Explanation first step import OrderedDict from collections that remove duplicates from list. next step, have initialized list that contains duplicate values. After this, have printed this list that becomes easy compare lists output. have passed list_values1 inside OrderedDict.fromkeys(). Finally, have displayed resultant list that does contain duplicate elements. Conclusion this tutorial, explored learned some interesting methods remove duplicates from list Python.
