next prev Python Line Generally, when print string using print statement, another print statement print another string line. When write print statement, after execution, automatically, cursor shifted line. does this happen? Can't print string line without using print statement? code becomes absurd keep writing print statements every string. answer both above questions escape sequence character called 'Python line character' represented '\n'. This article discusses line character with examples. Basic understanding: Character: '\n' Function: Shifts cursor line. character valid strings characters only. This character also called "line-break". escape sequence character Python. keep '\n' anywhere string. Syntax: declare string multiple lines: Str_var "\nstring 1\n string 2\n" print string multiple lines: print ("\nstr1\nstr2\n") Initial leaves blank line, shifts line prints str1 Middle shifts line after printing str1 prints str2 Final leaves blank line, shifts line after executing str2 Need '\n': Suppose trying print "Hello" first line, next line "world" line after that normal print statement: print ("Hello") print ('!') print ("World") Output: took lines code print words. code will longer want print more strings. Now, '\n': print ("Hello\n!\nWorld") Output: just took line. print number strings using '\n' multiple lines still keep code simple small. More about '\n': print statement printing '\n' like normal string? does Python recognize '\n'? have predefined characters Python succeeding back slash character ('\'), called 'Escape sequences'. Python recognizes immediately understands that part string executes based succeeding character. Using backslash before character helps character escape normal string execution. Examples: \t, etc. Declaring string with '\n': string "Hello\nWorld" print (string) print ("\n") print ("Hello\nWorld") Output: Understanding: above example: string arranged lines using stored string variable. Whenever want print string perform operations string, variable. used print with only line character give empty line gap. does print statement automatically shift line? Python, syntax print statement: print (values, '\n', file file, flush flush) Here, optional parameter. specifies last character want string with. default, '\n' assigned end, which why, after execution print statement, will shift cursor next line when don't give argument end. give argument end: print ("Hello", "!") print World") Output: Understanding: assigned end. Hence, after execution first print statement, second print statement shifted line follows "!" same line. Another print string line: There more shift line. First, multiple print statements. Second, '\n' character. achieve this using 'Multi-line strings' Python. single quotes double quotes print single-line string. Python, print multiple lines strings using either double quotes ("""strings""") three single quotes (''' string'''). Syntax: '''String String ............... String n''' """String String .............. String n""" Python recognizes that string multi-line string quotes """. Example: string '''Hello world''' string2 """I love Python""" print ("Using single quotes: print (string) print ("\n") print ("Using double quotes: print (string2) Output: Understanding: wrote multi-line strings using single quotes double-quotes. above code, though wrote multi-line strings, used '\n' blank line. more lines strings want print, more length code will Summary: print string line ways Python: Multiple print statements Using '\n.' Using multi-line strings. These three ways might useful different needs, programmers mostly '\n' print line because most commonly accepted method simplicity. Using '\n,' can: Print string multiple lines. Keep code short simple. Customize positions characters string. Leave blank line. Next Topic__init__ python prev next
