next prev sizeof Python When writing large scripts code many lines, memory management should utmost priority. Therefore, should have good knowledge handling memory efficiently addition good programming knowledge. have many functions given Python size memory particular object present program, such functions __sizeof__(). this tutorial, will learn about __sizeof__() function working inside Python program. Python __sizeof__() function __sizeof__() function Python doesn't exactly tell size object. doesn't return size generator object Python cannot tell beforehand that much size generator Still, actuality, returns internal size particular object bytes) occupying memory. understand this, look following example program with endless generator object. Example Look following Python program: default function with endless generator object endlessGenerator(): counting variable initialize generator counting Using while loop create endless generator while True: yield counting counting Creating infinite loop Printing memory size generator object print("Internal memory size endless generator object: endlessGenerator.__sizeof__()) Output Internal memory size endless generator object: Explanation: have used default function, i.e., endlessGenerator(), create endless generator object program. function, have initialized variable, i.e., counting have used while loop counting variable without giving breakpoint loop. creating infinite loop function, have made default function endless generator object. Finally, have printed internal memory size endless generator object using __sizeof__() function. Now, clearly understand functioning __sizeof__() function. endless generator object above program doesn't have breakpoint, Python can't tell size generator beforehand. same time, check internal memory size allotted generator object __sizeof__() function must occupying some internal memory Python. Let's look more example where __sizeof__() function internal memory size without overhead. Example Define empty list program emptyList Printing size empty list print("Internal memory size empty list: emptyList.__sizeof__()) Define some lists with elements [24] [24, 415, Printing internal memory size lists print("Memory size first list: a.__sizeof__()) print("Memory size second list: b.__sizeof__()) print("Memory size third list: c.__sizeof__()) print("Memory size fourth list: d.__sizeof__()) Output Internal memory size empty list: Memory size first list: Memory size second list: Memory size third list: Memory size fourth list: Explanation: Using __sizeof__() function, clearly that internal memory size empty list bytes every element present list adds bytes size total memory size list.
