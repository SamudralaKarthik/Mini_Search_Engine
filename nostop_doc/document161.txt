next prev Caesar Cipher Python this tutorial, will explore encryption methods called Caesar Cipher. part Cryptography. Introduction this technique, each character substituted letter certain fixed number position it's later before alphabet. example Alphabet replaced positions down would become This method named after popular frictional characters Julius Caesar, used communicate with officials. There algorithm used implement Let's understand following. Feature Caesar Cipher Algorithm This algorithm consists features that given below. This technique quite simple apply encryption. Each text replaced fixed number position down with alphabet. simple type substitute cipher. There integer value required define each latter text that been moved down. This integer value also known shift. represent this concept using modular arithmetic first transmuting letter into numbers, according schema, 3…….. following mathematical formula used shift letter. decrypt? decryption same encryption. create function that will accomplish shifting opposite path decrypt original text. However, cyclic property cipher under module. Cipher(n) De-cipher(26-n) same function used decryption. Instead, will modify shift value such that shifts shift. Let's understand following example Example encypt_func(txt, result transverse plain range(len(txt)): char txt[i] encypt_func uppercase characters plain (char.isupper()): result chr((ord(char) 65) encypt_func lowercase characters plain else: result chr((ord(char) 96) 97) return result check above function "CEASER CIPHER EXAMPLE" print("Plain txt) print("Shift pattern str(s)) print("Cipher: encypt_func(txt, s)) Output: Plain CEASER CIPHER EXAMPLE Shift pattern Cipher: HJFXJWsHNUMJWsJCFRUQJ above code traversed character time time. transferred each character rule depending procedure encryption decryption text. have defined specific position that generated cipher text. Breach Caesar Cipher Algorithm hack cipher text various ways. ways Brute Force Technique, which involves trying every possible decryption key. This technique hard doesn't require much effort. Let's understand following example. Example 'rGMTLIVrHIQSGIEWIVGIEWIV' #encrypted LETTERS 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' range(len(LETTERS)): transformation msg: LETTERS: LETTERS.find(s) len(LETTERS) transformation transformation LETTERS[n] else: transformation transformation print('Hacking #%s: (k, transformation)) Output: Hacking #25: rHNUMJWrIJRTHJFXJWHJFXJW Transposition Cipher Transposition cipher algorithm technique where alphabet order plaintext rearranged form cipher text. This algorithm doesn't support actual plain text alphabets. Let's understand this algorithm using example. Example will take simple example called columnar transposition cipher where write each character pain text horizontal with specified alphabet width. vertically written texts cipher, which create completely unlike cipher text. Let's take plain text, apply simple columnar transposition technique shown below. placed plain text horizontally cipher text created with vertical format hotnejpt.lao.lvi. decrypt this, receiver must same table decrypt cipher text plain text. Code Let's understand following example. split_len(sequence, length): return [sequence[i:i length] range(0, len(sequence), length)] encode(k, plaintxt): order int(val): enumerate(k) ciphertext index sorted(order.ks()): part split_len(plaintxt, len(k)): try:ciphertext part[order[index]] except IndexError: continue return ciphertext print(encode('3214', 'HELLO')) Explanation above code, have created function named split_len(), which spitted pain text character, placed columnar format. encode() method created cipher text with specifying number columns, have printed each cipher text reading through each column. Note transposition technique meant significant improvement crypto security. Cryptanalyst observed that re-encrypting cipher text using same transposition cipher shows better security.
