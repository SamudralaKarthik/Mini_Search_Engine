next prev Ternary Operator Python should priority developer working Python programming language write short, efficient, clean, readable lines code. order make things easier, Python provides Ternary operators which offer shorter convenient method writing conditional statements. Ternary operator Python allows evaluate condition True False. This operator occupies only line code, which implies that more concise than complete if-else statement. Conditional statements, like if-else statements, helps regulate program's flow. snippet code within conditional statements only executes when specific condition conditions) satisfied. programming languages like Python, if-else statement most common method order write conditional statements. However, introduction ternary operator Python offers test condition single line. following tutorial, will explore more about Ternary Operator, works, work some examples Python programming language. before that, discuss basics conditional statements. Understanding Conditional Statements Python While writing Python code, sometimes want execute block line code when specific condition satisfied. order perform such tasks functionalities, conditional statements become handy. if-else statement Python utilized order check condition met. consider example. Suppose that creating application that checks customer eligible discount movie theater. customer aged above, they should provided discount; otherwise, discount should provided. could if-else statement order create such program. Example: defining values variables first_num second_num None using if-else statement check larger number first_num second_num: first_num else: second_num printing data print("First Number:", first_num) print("Second Number:", second_num) print("Larger Number:", max) Output: First Number: Second Number: Larger Number: Explanation: above snippet code, have defined some variables first_num, second_num, max, specifying them with values like None. have then used if-else statement check which number more significant. last, have printed values users. result, program evaluated statements returned appropriate output. However, observe, if-else statement consumes multiple lines code. Thus, order reduce these lines code, Python developers adopt more concise write conditional statement while evaluating conditions only, that Ternary Operator Python. explore concept Ternary Operator Python programming language. Understanding Ternary Operator Python Ternary Operator type condition expression Python programming language that allows developers evaluate statements. Ternary Operators execute action depending that statement either True False. Thus, these operators more concise than traditional if-else statement. consider following syntax Ternary statement Python. Syntax: [true_condition] [expression] else [false_condition] name Python Ternary conditional operator derived from fact that accepts three parameters: true_condition, expression, false_condition. Ternary Operators generally utilized order determine variable's value. variable takes value "true_condition" statement results True "false_condition" statement results False. think ternary operators list comprehension used Python programming language order filter list. also think lambda function that used define function. Both lambda functions list comprehensions more effective methods order perform action (such defining function list filtration, respectively). Similarly, ternary operator turns more efficient effective method write if-else statement. However, like ternary operators, should them order improve code's readability should overboard with ternary operators; otherwise, code become much harder read. consider example based Ternary Operator Python Suppose that want include discount option event booking application customers older. customer younger than they eligible discount. could check whether customer entitled receive discount using snippet code shown below: Example: given customer cust_age using Ternary operator check discount eligibility cust_discount "Eligible Discount" cust_age else "Not Eligible Discount" printing result print( cust_discount Output: Eligible Discount Explanation: above snippet code, have defined variable storing value customer's age. have then used Ternary operator order check provided customer's lies under discount eligibility criteria printed result users. Since value which below thus program returned else statement users. comparing above example previous one, observe that this method utilizes significantly lesser lines code. consider another example better understanding. Suppose that need particular rate discount relying customer lies within eligibility criterion. default, event booking application providing customers discount; however, customers older eligible discount. snippet code given below, which checks customer eligible regular discount senior discount. Example: given customer cust_age using Ternary operator check discount eligibility cust_discount cust_age else printing result print( "Customer's Age: cust_age print( "Discount provided:", cust_discount Output: Customer's Age: Discount provided: Explanation: above snippet code, have defined variable storing value customer's age. have then used Ternary operator order check provided customer's lies under senior discount eligibility criteria printed result users. Since value which below thus program returned eligible discount statement users. Next TopicHow Calculate Area Circle using Python prev next
