next prev object iterable take python language under consideration, that error mainly arises while performing code, with proper rules. rules iterate object throughout while program runs. will raise error, named object iterable. Here term 'iterable' means through each string word till iterating over one. want iterate integer value, cannot iterate cannot break further subsequences, will raise popup error that cannot iterate integer value. question arises: whether iterate more than one-digit number? answer because python compiler will treat that number single digit, here drive same conclusion that object iterable; cannot break into parts. want separate each digits from number consisting more than digit, will different methods, using iteration. doing store digits form list that particular number. From above discussion, familiar with error object iterable arises whenever iterate integer value, which impossible. This error come under TypeError; type error usually arises whenever call function incorrect data type operator. example, perform addition operation between string integer object, will some error; this error mainly called type error because data type both objects does match. Thus, easily iterate list objects using loop, same thing with number. separate each digit number using loop, will store that particular number list. understand with help some examples: Examples TypeError: object iterable Example Here, this problem, provided with random number, will iterate using loop. Python program check TypeError: object iterable int(input("Enter random number check type error: print(i) Explanation: Here this above example, easily find that want iterate number, reading one. But, because combined treated single-digit unable break digit. desired output, rectify above program range function output above program: Correction above program: Python program check TypeError: object iterable int(input("Enter random number check type error: range(j): print(i) this correction part, have replaced passing into single function named range; after passing number range function then python programming language will easily recognize working built-in function range python main role return sequence number begins from itself default then incremented until reaches value, that passed arguments this function. output above program: Enter random number check type error: Example Here this problem provided with random list numbers some string values will iterate using loop. Python program check TypeError: object iterable costlist [200, 219.2, 238, 316.7, 779, 100] taxlist index len(costlist): taxlist.append(costlist[index] (costlist[index] *0.25)) print(taxlist) Explanation: Here this above example, observe, easily find that want iterate number, reading one. because combined treated single-digit unable break digit. desired output, rectify above program range function output above program: Correction above program: Python program check TypeError: object iterable costlist [200, 219.2, 238, 316.7, 779, 100] taxlist index range(len(costlist)): taxlist.append(costlist[index] (costlist[index] *0.25)) print(taxlist) this correction part, have replaced passing into single function named range; after passing number range function then python programming language will easily recognize working built-in function range python main role return sequence number begins from itself default then incremented until reaches value, that passed arguments this function. output above program: Example Here, this problem, provided with random number, will iterate using loop. Python program check TypeError: object iterable int(input("Enter random number check type error: num: print(i) Explanation: Here this above example, observe, easily find that want iterate number, reading one, because combined treated single-digit unable break digit. desired output, rectify above program range function output above program: Correction above program: Python program check TypeError: object iterable int(input("Enter random number check type error: range(num): print(i) this correction part, have replaced passing into single function named range; after passing number range function then python programming language will easily recognize working built-in function range python main role return sequence number begins from itself default then incremented until reaches value, that passed arguments this function. output above program: Enter random number check type error: Example Here, this problem, provided with random number, want separate digits that number. Python program check TypeError: object iterable int(input("Enter random number check type error Digit=[int(i) num] Explanation: Here this above example, observe, easily find that want iterate number, 110892, reading one, because combined treated single-digit unable break digit. store separated digits list easily access each digit number, above example, type error arises where object iterable. getting desired output, rectify above program. output above program: Correction above program: Python program check TypeError: object iterable int(input("Enter random number check type error Digit=[int(i) str(num)] print(Digit) this correction part, have replaced passing into single function named str; using this function, easily break particular number and, combined form, store them list, python programming language will easily recognize working built-in function python. output above program: Next TopicPython Peewee Library prev next
