next prev String Binary Python this article, will learn convert string binary equivalent Python. know that strings sequence strings denoted with inverted commas. Binary numbers form 1s, information always encoded binary format since this what computer understands. methods converting string binary that will here using join(), ord(), format() bytearray(). should take corresponding ASCII values characters that present string convert them into binary. have look description functions that have taken toolbox- join()- takes items joins them make single entity(results single string). ord()- This method takes character converts into corresponding UNICODE value. format()- This method takes value inserts where placeholders present, also used merge parts string specified intervals. bytearray()- returns array bytes. following program shows done- Example declaring string str_to_conv "Let's learn Python" printing string that will converted print("The string that have taken ",str_to_conv) using join() ord() format() convert into binary bin_result ''.join(format(ord(x), '08b') str_to_conv) printing result print("The string that obtain binary conversion ",bin_result) Output- string that have taken Let's learn Python string that obtain binary conversion 010011000110010101110100001001110111001100100000011011000110010101100001011100100110111000100000010100000111100101110100011010000110111101101110 Explanation understand what have done above program- First all, have declared string that needs converted binary with value 'Let's learn Python'. next step display string have created that easy comprehend with help output which string what binary equivalent. Then, have used format() method specified parameters ord() '08b' that takes each character from string using loop convert them into binary. overall result stored variable bin_result finally, display value. next example, will same thing using bytearray(). Example declaring string str_to_conv "Let's learn Python" printing string that will converted print("The string that have taken ",str_to_conv) using join(), format() bytearray() convert into binary bin_result ''.join(format(x,'08b') bytearray(str_to_conv,'utf-8')) printing result print("The string that obtain binary conversion ",bin_result) Output- string that have taken Let's learn Python string that obtain binary conversion 010011000110010101110100001001110111001100100000011011000110010101100001011100100110111000100000010100000111100101110100011010000110111101101110 Example different above approach was- First all, have declared string that needs converted binary with value 'Let's learn Python'. next step display string have created that easy comprehend with help output which string what binary equivalent. Then have used bytearray() function, which each character from string taken using loop converted into binary. overall result stored variable bin_result finally, display value.
