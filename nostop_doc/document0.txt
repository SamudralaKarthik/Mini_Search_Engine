next Python Tutorial Python Programming Language Python tutorial provides basic advanced concepts Python. Python tutorial designed beginners professionals. Python simple, general purpose, high level, object-oriented programming language. Python interpreted scripting language also. Guido Rossum known founder Python programming. Python tutorial includes topics Python Programming such installation, control statements, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Modules, Exceptions, Date Time, File I/O, Programs, etc. There also given Python interview questions help better understand Python Programming. What Python Python general purpose, dynamic, high-level, interpreted programming language. supports Object Oriented programming approach develop applications. simple easy learn provides lots high-level data structures. Python easy learn powerful versatile scripting language, which makes attractive Application Development. Python's syntax dynamic typing with interpreted nature make ideal language scripting rapid application development. Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, functional procedural programming styles. Python intended work particular area, such programming. That known multipurpose programming language because used with web, enterprise, CAD, etc. don't need data types declare variable because dynamically typed write a=10 assign integer value integer variable. Python makes development debugging fast because there compilation step included Python development, edit-test-debug cycle very fast. Python Python most programming languages, whenever version releases, supports features syntax existing version language, therefore, easier projects switch newer version. However, case Python, versions Python Python very much different from each other. list differences between Python Python given below: Python uses print statement used print "something" print some string console. other hand, Python uses print function used print("something") print something console. Python uses function raw_input() accept user's input. returns string representing value, which typed user. convert into integer, need int() function Python. other hand, Python uses input() function which automatically interpreted type input entered user. However, cast this value type using primitive functions (int(), str(), etc.). Python implicit string type ASCII, whereas, Python implicit string type Unicode. Python doesn't contain xrange() function Python xrange() variant range() function which returns xrange object that works similar Java iterator. range() returns list example function range(0,3) contains There also small change made Exception handling Python defines keyword which necessary used. will discuss Exception handling section Python programming tutorial. Java Python Program Unlike other programming languages, Python provides facility execute code using lines. example Suppose want print "Hello World" program Java; will take three lines print Java Program public class HelloWorld public static void main(String[] args){ Prints "Hello, World" terminal window. System.out.println("Hello World"); Python Program other hand, this using statement Python. print("Hello World") Both programs will print same result, takes only statement without using semicolon curly braces Python. Python Basic Syntax There curly braces semicolon Python programming language. English-like language. Python uses indentation define block code. Indentation nothing adding whitespace before statement when needed. example func(): statement statement ………………… ………………… statement above example, statements that same level right belong function. Generally, four whitespaces define indentation. Python History Python invented Guido Rossum 1991 CWI Netherland. idea Python programming language taken from programming language that predecessor Python language. There also fact behind choosing name Python. Guido Rossum popular comedy show that time, "Monty Python's Flying Circus". decided pick name Python newly created programming language. Python vast community across world releases version within short period. learn Python? Python provides many useful features programmer. These features make most popular widely used language. have listed below few-essential feature Python. Easy Learn Expressive Language Interpreted Language Object-Oriented Language Open Source Language Extensible Learn Standard Library Programming Support Integrated Embeddable Dynamic Memory Allocation Wide Range Libraries Frameworks Where Python used? Python general-purpose, popular programming language used almost every technical field. various areas Python given below. Data Science Date Mining Desktop Applications Console-based Applications Mobile Applications Software Development Artificial Intelligence Applications Enterprise Applications Applications Machine Learning Computer Vision Image Processing Applications. Speech Recognitions Python Popular Frameworks Libraries Python wide range libraries frameworks widely used various fields such machine learning, artificial intelligence, applications, etc. define some popular frameworks libraries Python follows. development (Server-side) Django Flask, Pyramid, CherryPy GUIs based applications PyGTK, PyQt, PyJs, etc. Machine Learning TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Scipy, etc. Mathematics Numpy, Pandas, etc. Python print() Function print() function displays given object standard output device (screen) text stream file. Unlike other programming languages, Python print() function most unique versatile function. syntax print() function given below. print(*objects, sep=' end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False) Let's explain parameters one. objects object nothing statement that printed. sign represents that there multiple statements. parameter separates print values. Default values printed last statement. file must object with write(string) method. flush stream file forcibly flushed true. default, value false. Let's understand following example. Example Return value print("Welcome javaTpoint.") objects passed print() function print("a Three objects passed print function print('a b') Output: Welcome javaTpoint. above output, multiple objects printed single print() statement. just need comma separate with each other. Example Using argument print("a sep='dddd', end='\n\n\n') print("a sep='0', end='$$$$$') Output: =dddd10 =010$$$$$ first print() statement, arguments. given object printed just after values. value parameter printed last given object. that, second print() function printed result after three black lines. Taking Input User Python provides input() function which used take input from user. Let's understand following example. Example name input("Enter name student:") print("The student name name) Output: Enter name student: Devansh student name Devansh default, input() function takes string input what want take other data types input. want take input integer number, need typecast input() function into integer. example Example int(input("Enter first number: int(input("Enter second number: print(a+b) Output: Enter first number: Enter second number: take type values using input() function. Python Operators Operators symbols which perform various operations Python objects. Python operators most essential work with Python data types. addition, Python also provides identify membership bitwise operators. will learn these operators with suitable example following tutorial. Python Operators Python Conditional Statements Conditional statements help execute particular block particular condition. this tutorial, will learn conditional expression execute different block statements. Python provides else keywords logical conditions. elif keyword also used conditional statement. Python if..else statement Python Loops Sometimes need alter flow program. execution specific code need repeated several numbers times. this purpose, programming languages provide various types loops capable repeating some specific code several times. Consider following tutorial understand statements detail. Python Loops Python Loop Python While Loop Python Data Structures Data structures referred which hold some data together that they used store data organized way. Python provides built-in data structures such list, tuple, dictionary, set. perform complex tasks using data structures. Python List Python list holds ordered collection items. store sequence items list. Python list mutable which means modified after creation. items lists enclosed within square bracket separated comma. Let's example list. ["John", 102, "USA"] print type using type() function then will come list. print(type(L1)) print(type(L2)) Output: <class 'list'> <class 'list'> learn more about list, visit following tutorial. Python List Python List Functions Python Tuple Python Tuple used store sequence immutable Python objects. tuple similar lists since value items stored list changed, whereas tuple immutable, value items stored tuple cannot changed. Tuple defined follows Example ("Apple", "Mango" "Orange" "Banana") print(type(tup)) print(tup) Output: <class 'tuple'> ('Apple', 'Mango', 'Orange', 'Banana') tuple, will throw error. Example ("Apple", "Mango" "Orange" "Banana") tup[2] "Papaya" print(tup) Output: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:/Users/DEVANSH SHARMA/PycharmProjects/Hello/gamewithturtle.py", line tup[2] "Papaya" TypeError: 'tuple' object does support item assignment above program throws error because tuples immutable type. learn more about tuple, visit Python Tuples. Python Tuple Python String Python string sequence characters. collection characters surrounded single quotes, double quotes, triple quotes. also define collection Unicode characters. create string follows. Example Creating string using double quotes str1 Python" print(str1) Creating string using single quotes str1 Python' print(str1) Creating string using triple quotes str1 '''Hi Python''' print(str1) Output: Python Python Python Python doesn't support character data-type. single character written treated string length Stings also immutable. can't change after declared. learn more about string, visit following tutorial. Python Strings Python String Method Dictionaries Python Dictionary most efficient data structure used store large amount data. stores data key-value pair format. Each value stored corresponding key. Keys must unique value type such integer, list, tuple, etc. mutable type; reassign after creation. Below example creating dictionary Python. Example employee {"Name": "John", "Age": "salary":250000,"Company":"GOOGLE"} print(type(employee)) print("printing Employee data .... print(employee) Output: <class 'dict'> Printing Employee data .... {'Name': 'John', 'Age': 'salary': 250000, 'Company': 'GOOGLE'} empty curly braces used create empty dictionary. learn more, visit complete tutorial dictionary. Python Dictionary Python Dictionary Methods Python Sets Python collection unordered elements. Each element must unique immutable. Sets mutable which means modify anytime throughout program. Let's understand example creating Python. Example Creating Month {"January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July"} print(Month) print(type(Month)) Output: {'March', 'July', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'February', 'January'} <class 'set'> more information about sets, visit following resources.
