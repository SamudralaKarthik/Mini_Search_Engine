next prev create vector Python using NumPy this tutorial, will learn create vector using Numpy library. will also explore basic operation vector such performing addition vectors, subtraction vectors, division vectors, multiplication vectors, vector product vector scalar product. What Vector? vector known single dimension-array. Python, vector single one-dimension array lists behaves same Python list. According Google, vector represents direction well magnitude; especially determines position point space relative another. Vectors very important Machine learning because they have magnitude also direction features. Let's understand create vector Python. Creating Vector Python Python Numpy module provides numpy.array() method which creates dimensional array i.e. vector. vector horizontal vertical. Syntax: np.array(list) above method accepts list argument returns numpy.ndarray. Let's understand following example Example Horizontal Vector Importing numpy import numpy creating list list1 [10, Creating Horizontal Array np.array(list1) np.array(list1) print("We create vector from list:") print(vtr) Output: create vector from list: Example Vertical Vector Importing numpy import numpy defining list list1 [[12], [40], [6], [10]] Creating Vertical Array np.array(list1) np.array(list1) print("We create vector from list:") print(vtr) Output: create vector from list: [[12] [40] [10]] Basic Operation Python vector After creating vector, will perform arithmetic operations vectors. Below list basic operations that perform vector. Arithmetic Subtraction Multiplication Division Product Scalar Multiplications Addition Vectors vector addition, takes place element-wise manner which means addition will happen element element length would same additive vectors. Syntax: vector vector Let's understand following example. Example import numpy list1 [10,20,30,40,50] list2 [11,12,13,14,15] vtr1 np.array(list1) vtr2= np.array(list2) print("We create vector from list 1:") print(vtr1) print("We create vector from list 2:") print(vtr2) vctr_add vctr1+vctr2 print("Addition vectors: ",vtr_add) Output: create vector from list create vector from list [11 Addition vectors: [21 65] Subtraction Vectors subtraction performs same addition, follows element-wise approach vector elements will subtracted from vector Let's understand following example. Example import numpy list1 [10,20,30,40,50] list2 [5,2,4,3,1] vtr1 np.array(list1) vtr2= np.array(list2) print("We create vector from list 1:") print(vtr1) print("We create vector from list 2:") print(vtr2) vtr_sub vtr1-vtr2 print("Subtraction vectors: ",vtr_sub) Output: create vector from list create vector from list Subtraction vectors: 49] Multiplication Vectors vector elements multiplied vector return same length vectors multiplying vectors. Let's understand following example. Example import numpy list1 [10,20,30,40,50] list2 [5,2,4,3,1] vtr1 np.array(list1) vtr2= np.array(list2) print("We create vector from list 1:") print(vtr1) print("We create vector from list 2:") print(vtr2) vtr_mul vtr1*vtr2 print("Multiplication vectors: ",vtr_mul) Output: create vector from list create vector from list Multiplication vectors: multiplication performed follows. vct[0] x[0] y[0] vct[1] x[1] y[1] first element vector multiplied corresponding vector's first element Division Operation vectors division operation, resultant vector contains quotient value that from division vector's elements. Let's understand following example. Example import numpy list1 [10,20,30,40,50] list2 [5,2,4,3,1] vtr1 np.array(list1) vtr2= np.array(list2) print("We create vector from list 1:") print(vtr1) print("We create vector from list 2:") print(vtr2) vtr_div vtr1/vtr2 print("Division vectors: ",vtr_div) Output: create vector from list create vector from list Division vectors: 13.33333333 above output, division operation returned quotient value elements. Vector Product vector product performs between same-length sequential vectors returns single product. will .dot() method perform product. will happen below. vector Let's understand following example. Example import numpy list1 [10,20,30,40,50] list2 [5,2,4,3,1] vtr1 np.array(list1) vtr2= np.array(list2) print("We create vector from list 1:") print(vtr1) print("We create vector from list 2:") print(vtr2) vtr_product vtr1.dot(vtr2) print("Dot product vectors: ",vtr_product) Output: create vector from list create vector from list product vectors: 380 Vector-Scalar Multiplication scalar multiply operation; multiply scalar with each component vector. Let's understand following example. Example import numpy list1 [10,20,30,40,50] vtr1 np.array(list1) scalar_value print("We create vector from list 1:") print(vtr1) printing scalar value print("Scalar Value str(scalar_value)) vtr_scalar vtr1 scalar_value print("Multiplication vectors: ",vtr_scalar) Output: create vector from list Scalar Value Multiplication vectors: 250] above code, scalar value multiplied each element vector v2, v3) manner.
