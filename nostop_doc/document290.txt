next prev Augmented Assignment Expressions Python Python, know arithmetic operators used add, subtract, divide multiply variables. this article, will learn extend functionality operator precise form time evaluating expression. have look examples that will make augmented assignment expressions clear will discuss following expression will have look programs that involve augmented assignment expressions understand they used. Using program given below, have done following operations- First, have added variables Used augmented assignment addition adding Example #adding numbers x=15 y=10 z=x+y print("Value ",z) x+=5 #x=x+5 print("Value ",x) Output Value Value Using program given below, have done following operations- First, have subtracted variables Used augmented assignment subtraction subtracting Example #subtracting numbers x=15 y=10 z=x-y print("Value ",z) x-=5 #x=x-5 print("Value ",x) Output Value Value Using program given below, have done following operations- First, have multiplied variables Used augmented assignment multiplication multiplying Example #multiplying numbers x=15 y=10 z=x*y print("Value ",z) x*=5 #x=x*5 print("Value ",x) Output Value Value Using program given below, have done following operations- First, have divided variables Used augmented assignment division dividing Example #dividing numbers x=15 y=10 z=x/y print("Value ",z) x/=5 #x=x/5 print("Value ",x) Output Value Value Using program given below, have done following operations- First, have taken modulus variables Used augmented assignment modulus operation obtaining results Example #modulus numbers x=15 y=10 z=x%y print("Value ",z) x%=5 #x=x%5 print("Value ",x) Output Value Value Using below program, have performed following operations- First, have calculated raised power Used augmented assignment expression evaluate raised power Example #power numbers x=15 z=x**y print("Value ",z) x**=3 #x=x**3 print("Value ",x) Output Value Value 3375 Using below program, have performed following operations- First, have calculated value integer division Used augmented assignment expression evaluate integer division Example #integer division numbers x=15 z=x//y print("Value ",z) x//=3 #x=x//3 print("Value ",x) Output Value Value Using below program, have evaluated expression bitwise right shift between variables Example #bitwise right shift numbers x=15 x>>=y print("Value ",x) Output Value Using below program, have evaluated expression bitwise left shift between variables Example #bitwise left shift numbers x=15 x<<=y print("Value ",x) Output Value Using below program, have evaluated expression bitwise shift between variables Example #bitwise numbers x=15 x&=y print("Value ",x) Output Value this article, learned augmented assignment expressions used Python.
