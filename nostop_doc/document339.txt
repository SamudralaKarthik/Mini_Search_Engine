next prev choice() Python this tutorial, will discuss usage choice() method Python. this program, need first import random module. function choice() pick generate random element that anything number string from given collection. Syntax syntax using choice() random.choice(x) have look some programs that will make it's application clear. Program Consider following program- import random list_values=["C","C++","Python","Java","PHP"] print(random.choice(list_values)) Output: Java Explanation: It's time have look explanation program given above- first step, have imported random module. After this, have initialized list that contains different string values. Finally, have used choice() pick certain string from provided list display value. Program second program, will used take random character from string. import random string_value="Python JavaTpoint" print(random.choice(string_value)) Output: Explanation: Let's understand what happened here- first step, have imported random module. After this, have initialized string called "Python JavaTpoint. Finally, have used choice() pick certain character from provided string display it's value. Program Now, let's have look more program discuss another approach writing this method. import random print("The random element from(1,2,3,4,5) ",random.choice([1,2,3,4,5])) print("The random element from(a,b,c,d,e,f) ",random.choice(['a','b','c','d','e','f'])) Output: random element from(1,2,3,4,5) random element from(a,b,c,d,e,f) Explanation: Let's what have done this program- first step, have imported random module. After this, have written print statements that will display value. then observe that have used random.choice() print function itself pick certain character element from provided list display value. Program next program, shall choose definite number values displayed output. #importing random import random #initializing list list_values=[1, #taking random value from list res=random.choices(list_values, k=4) print(res) Output: [2,2,3,2] Explanation: It's time have look explanation program given above- first step, have imported random module. After this, have initialized list that contains different numeric values. Finally, have used random.choice() which have specified list name value parameters. executing program, observe that number elements returned list depends value Program Now, will loop used meet same objective. following program illustrates same- #importing random import random #initializing list list_values=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] #using loop range(6): print(random.choice(list_values)) Output: Program next program, will random value from given range numbers taken. #importing random import random #taking random number num_value random.choice(range(10,120)) print("A random number from given range is",num_value) Output: random number from given range Explanation: Let's what have done this program- first step, have imported random module. After this, have specified range numbers choice(). executing given program, displays expected output. Now, will learn Boolean values using choice(). Displaying Boolean Result following program shows obtain Boolean values. #importing random import random #taking random boolean value val=random.choice([True,False]) print("The boolean value is",val) Output: boolean value False Explanation: It's time have look explanation program given above- first step, have imported random module. After this, have specified True False inside choice(). executing given program, expected output displayed. Program Finally, last program illustrates random.getrandbits() used same purpose. #importing random import random #taking random boolean value val=random.getrandbits(1) print(bool(val)) Output: False procedure above program similar previous program, only difference here have used random.getrandbits(). Conclusion this tutorial, learned different ways using choice() Python program. Next TopicConvert List dataframe Python prev next
