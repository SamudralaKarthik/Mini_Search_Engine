Django Cookie Implementation following steps, will cookie using Django. Create required configuration include following code view.py. setcookie(request): html HttpResponse("<h1>Welcome Django Website</h1>") html.set_cookie('Django', setting cookie', max_age None) return html Now, this view urls.py. path('setcookie', views.setcookie) Here, will write view cookies. view.py getcookie(request): show request.COOKIES['Django?] html "<center> Page <br>{0}</center>".format(show) return HttpResponse(html) urls.py path('getcookie', views.showcookie), Output: Explanation above code above view.py, have used HttpResponse method that displays output screen. define cookie separate functions first function will cookies user's computer second function with variable COOKIE appended displaying receiving cookie that been set. Now, server using following command. python manage.py runserver Updating Cookie modify defined cookie. Let's following example. updating_cookie(request): html HttpResponse("We updating cookie which before") html.set_cookie('JavaTpoint','Updated Successfully') return html After updating cookie, need append into urls.py file. path('updating_cookie', views.updating_cookie), Now, server visit below page.
