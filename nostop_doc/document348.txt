next prev Writing Python Module seems difficult create your Python module, what that creating writing Python program very simple task. this tutorial, going write Python module, after writing will also inside Python script. before this, let's first understand that what Python module Python Module Python file that contains various statements definitions called Python module, have variables, classes various functions Like simple Python script, runnable Python code also present inside Python module. Python module becomes more useful when group relatable code them module inside Python program, with help Python module, even make code logically organized. Python module inside Python program simply using 'import' statement. Example: import module Suppose, Python module, i.e., module1, three functions present want only them code then also import only single function using from statement with import like used below: Example: import function1 from module1 have learned about Python module have basic idea that Python module works imported into program, will move forward writing part Writing Python Module this section, going write Python module understand that module, have written inside Python program. create write Python module just like create Python script, better say; even Python script Python module inside another Python script. this will only valid Python script which will using Python module present same location where Python installed system. let's create Python script first save with '.py' extension save same location where Python present. Follow following given steps write create simple Python module: Step Writing Runnable Program: First, have write runnable program inside Python shell opening file example, will write following addition function program inside Python file: default Python function performing addition addition(x, variables parameters Adding variables storing results another variable addValue Returning addition result numbers return addValue Step Saving File: Now, after writing addition program given first step, will save file with 'adding.py' name default directory assigned Python. Now, have created 'adding' module, this imported into Python program addition function adding variables. Let's 'adding' script Python module perform addition operation following example program: Importing adding module program import adding Taking input variables from user int(input("Enter first integer variable: int(input("Enter second integer variable: Adding variables with function 'adding' module addResult addition(a1, Printing result output print("The integer variables given addResult) Output: Enter first integer variable: Enter second integer variable: integer variables given Explanation: above program, have performed addition operation input variables have taken from user. have used addition function adding module importing this module inside program. last, printed addition result variables output ended program. Conclusion create write Python module simply writing Python program with functions classes then module have created inside another program simply importing inside program. even single function from program using additional 'from' keyword with import statement. With help Python module, make code logically organized group similar code together single module. Next TopicModules Packages Python prev next
