next prev install statsmodels Python? aspire flourishing career field machine learning, introduce more interesting package whose functionalities would leave awestruck. let's what statsmodels what features? Statsmodels popular library Python that enables estimate analyze various statistical models. built numeric scientific libraries like NumPy SciPy. Some essential features this package are- includes various models linear regression like ordinary least squares, generalized least squares, weighted least squares, etc. provides some efficient functions time series analysis. also some datasets examples testing. Models based survival analysis also available. statistical tests that imagine data large scale present. Installing statsmodels Let's have look steps installing statsmodels Python- Checking version Python installed PCs, have discussed this already previous articles let's talk about this again- There ways check version Python Windows- Using Powershell Using Command Prompt Using PowerShell Follow below steps check version Python using PowerShell. Click 'Win+R' type 'Run' taskbar's search pane. Type 'Powershell' window will appear your screen named 'Windows Powershell' Click 'Enter' Type python -version click 'Enter' version would displayed next line. Using Command Prompt Type 'Command Prompt' taskbar's search pane you'll icon. Click open command prompt. Also, directly click icon pinned taskbar. Once 'Command Prompt' screen visible your screen. Type python -version click 'Enter'. version installed your system would displayed next line. Checking Version Python Linux Linux, have shell where type commands that interpreted tells operating system about what user wants. steps check version Python Linux Start your system switch Linux operating system (you might find with name Ubuntu). Once desktop screen Linux appears, click 'Terminal' open terminal window, type python -version click 'Enter'. next line, will display current version python installed your system. Installation statsmodels discuss steps installing statsmodels system. will look methods installation Using Anaconda Prompt Using Command Prompt first method, will open Anaconda Prompt type following command- conda install conda-forge statsmodels second method, will open Command Prompt, type following command click 'Enter'. install statsmodels It's time look have program which will import statsmodels- Here, will perform OLS(Ordinary Least Squares) regression, this technique will minimize squares difference between calculated value observed value. Example import pandas import statsmodels.api df=pd.read_csv("/content/SampleSuperstore.csv") df.head() x=df['Sales'] y=df['Profit'] model=sm.OLS(y,x).fit() model_summary=model.summary() print(model_summary) Output- this tutorial, discussed what steps involved installing statsmodels obtain detailed statistical summary dataset with aid.
