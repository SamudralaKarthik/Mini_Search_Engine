next prev Python History Versions Python laid foundation late 1980s. implementation Python started December 1989 Guido Rossum CWI Netherland. February 1991, Guido Rossum published code (labeled version 0.9.0) alt.sources. 1994, Python released with features like lambda, map, filter, reduce. Python added features such list comprehensions, garbage collection systems. December 2008, Python (also called "Py3K") released. designed rectify fundamental flaw language. programming language said predecessor Python language, which capable Exception Handling interfacing with Amoeba Operating System. following programming languages influence Python: language. Modula-3 Name Python? There fact behind choosing name Python. Guido Rossum reading script popular comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". late on-air 1970s. Rossum wanted select name which unique, sort, little-bit mysterious. decided select naming Python after "Monty Python's Flying Circus" their newly created programming language. comedy series creative well random. talks about everything. Thus slow unpredictable, which made very interesting. Python also versatile widely used every technical field, such Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Development, Mobile Application, Desktop Application, Scientific Calculation, etc. Python Version List Python programming language being updated regularly with features supports. There lots update Python versions, started from 1994 current release. list Python versions with released date given below. Python VersionReleased Date Python 1.0January 1994 Python 1.5December 1997 Python 1.6September 2000 Python 2.0October 2000 Python 2.1April 2001 Python 2.2December 2001 Python 2.3July 2003 Python 2.4November 2004 Python 2.5September 2006 Python 2.6October 2008 Python 2.7July 2010 Python 3.0December 2008 Python 3.1June 2009 Python 3.2February 2011 Python 3.3September 2012 Python 3.4March 2014 Python 3.5September 2015 Python 3.6December 2016 Python 3.7June 2018 Python 3.8October 2019 Tips Keep Mind While Learning Python most common question asked beginners "What best learn Python"? initial relevant question because first step learning programming language know learn. proper learning will help learn fast become good Python developer. this section, will discuss various tips that should keep mind while learning Python. Make Clear Want Learn goal should clear before learning Python. Python easy, vast language well. includes numbers libraries, modules, in-built functions data structures. goal unclear then will boring monotonous journey learning Python. Without clear goal, perhaps won't make done. first figure motivation behind learning, which anything such knowing something new, develop projects using Python, switch Python, etc. Below general areas where Python widely used. Pick them. Data Analysis Processing Artificial Intelligence Games Hardware/Sensor/Robots Desktop Applications Choose areas according your interest start journey towards learning Python. Learn Basic Syntax most essential basic step learn syntax Python programming language. have learn basic syntax before dive deeper into learning have discussed earlier tutorial, Python easy learn simple syntax. doesn't semicolon brackets. syntax like English language. will take minimum amount time learning syntax. Once syntax properly, further learning will easier quicker getting work projects. Note Learn Python Python 2.7, because industry longer uses Python tutorial based latest version Python Write Code Writing code most effective robust learn Python. First, write code paper mind (Dry Run) then move system. Writing code paper will help familiar quickly with syntax concept store deep memory. While writing code, proper functions suitable variables names. There many editors available Python programming which highlights syntax related issue automatically. don't need attention these mistakes. Keep Practicing next important step practice. needs implementing Python concepts through code. should consistence daily coding practice. Consistency success aspect life only programming. Writing code daily will help develop muscle memory. problem exercise related concepts solve least problems Python. seem hard muscle memory plays large part programing. will take ahead from those believe only reading concept Python sufficient. Make Notes Needed Creating notes excellent method learn concepts syntax Python. will establish stability focus that helps become Python developer. Make brief concise notes with relevant information include appropriate examples subject concerned. Maintain notes also helped learn fast. study published Psychological Science that students were taking longhand notes studies were forced more selective â€” because can't write fast type. Discuss Concepts with Other Coding seems solitary activity, enhance skills interacting with others. should discuss doubts expert friends learning Python. This habit will help additional information, tips tricks, solution coding problems. best advantages Python, great community. Therefore, also learn from passionate Python enthusiasts. small Projects After understanding Python's basic concept, beginner should work small projects. will help understand Python more deeply become more component Theoretical knowledge enough command over Python language. These projects anything long they teach something. start with small projects such calculator app, tic-toc-toe game, alarm clock app, to-do list, student customer management system, etc. Once handy with small project, easily shift toward your interesting domain (Machine Learning, Development, etc.). Teach Others There famous saying that want learn something then should teach other". also true case learning Python. Share your information other students creating blog posts, recording videos taking classes local training center. will help enhance understanding Python explore unseen loopholes your knowledge. don't want these, join online forum post your answers Python related questions. Explore Libraries Frameworks Python consists vast libraries various frameworks. After getting familiar with Python's basic concepts, next step explore Python libraries. Libraries essential work with domain specific projects. following section, describe brief introduction main libraries. TensorFlow artificial intelligence library which allows create large scale based projects. Django open source framework that allows develop applications. easy, flexible, simple manage. Flask also open source framework. used develop lightweight applications. Pandas Python library which used perform scientific computations. Keras open source library, which used work around neural network. There many libraries Python. Above, have mentioned them. Contribute Open Source know, Python open source language that means freely available everyone. also contribute Python online community enhance knowledge. Contributing open source projects best explore knowledge. also receive feedback, comments suggestions work that submitted. feedback will enable best practices Python programming help become good Python developer. Usage Python Python general purpose, open source, high-level programming language also provides number libraries frameworks. Python gained popularity because simplicity, easy syntax user-friendly environment. usage Python follows. Desktop Applications Applications Data Science Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning Scientific Computing Robotics Internet Things (IoT) Gaming Mobile Apps Data Analysis Preprocessing next topic, will discuss Python Application, where have defined Python's usage detail.
