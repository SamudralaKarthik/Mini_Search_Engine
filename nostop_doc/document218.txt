next prev Data Hiding Python What Data Hiding? Data hiding part object-oriented programming, which generally used hide data information from user. includes internal object details such data members, internal working. maintained data integrity restricted access class member. main working data hiding that combines data functions into single unit conceal data within class. cannot directly access data from outside class. This process also known data encapsulation. done hiding working information user. process, declare class members private that other class access these data members. accessible only within class. Data Hiding Python Python most popular programming language applies every technical domain straightforward syntax vast libraries. official Python documentation, Data hiding isolates client from part program implementation. Some essential members must hidden from user. Programs modules only reflected could them, users cannot familiar with application works. Thus provides security avoiding dependency well. perform data hiding Python using double underscore before prefix. This makes class members private inaccessible other classes. Let's understand following example. Example class CounterClass: __privateCount count(self): self.__privateCount print(self.__privateCount) counter CounterClass() counter.count() counter.count() print(counter.__privateCount) Output: Traceback (most recent call last): File "<string>", line <module> AttributeError: 'CounterClass' object attribute '__privateCount' However access private member using class name. print(counter.CounterClass__privatecounter) Output: Advantages Data Hiding Below main advantages data hiding. class objects disconnected from irrelevant data. enhances security against hackers that unable access important data. isolates object basic concept OOP. helps programmer from incorrect linking corrupt data. isolate object from basic concept OOP. provides high security which stops damage violate data hiding from public. Disadvantages Data Hiding Every coin sides there advantages then there will disadvantage well. Here some disadvantages given below. Sometimes programmers need write extra lien code. data hiding prevents linkage that link between visible invisible data makes object faster. forces programmers write extra code hide important data from common users. Conclusion Data hiding important aspect when comes privacy security particularly within application. plays essential role preventing unauthorized access. some disadvantages, these avoidable front advantages.
