next prev Print List Without Brackets Python? This tutorial explains print Python list without using square brackets. We're going assume that know fundamentals lists. There several ways print lists that remove square brackets, which thoroughly detailed below. Python Techniques Printing List Without Brackets Python programming language, there three ways print list without brackets. Python loop. asterisk operator Python join() function Using Python Loop Print List Without Brackets Printing list's components using loop among most straightforward solutions immediately coming mind. Print each list element, separated commas, using Python loop iterate through list elements time. instance: Code Python program print Python list without brackets Creating list numbers ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"] Using loop print list elements numbers: print(i, end=" Output: Python loop iterates through list prints items from lists during each cycle program above. Each element separated from others argument. also commas another character split items providing parameter. Using Asterisk Print List Without Brackets List items unpacked using asterisk(*) operator. components iterable objects unpacked using this Python operator. this operator extract list elements output them without brackets, Python list also iterable object. instance Code Python program print Python list without brackets using operator Creating list numbers Using operator print(*numbers, Output: integers, floating-point numbers, string data types used using this function. providing "sep", character between elements. instance: Code Python program print Python list without brackets using operator Creating list numbers Using operator print(*numbers, Output: Using Join() Function Print List Without Brackets join() function accepts iterable data type input, such Python list, tuple, string, set, dictionary. produces string which each member connected other character supplied function. instance: Let's would like print list elements that have numbers their elements. join function link these numbers with commas between these elements. Code Python program print Python list without brackets using join() function Creating list numbers ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"] Using join() function print(', '.join(numbers)) Output: Similarly, substitute space comma previous case, program above will produce numbers without commas between them. Code Python program print Python list without brackets using join() function Creating list numbers ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"] Using join() function print(' '.join(numbers)) Output: just list strings with this technique; integer float elements will cause fail. lists that contain numbers, map() method turn list elements into string before using join() method. method iterable main arguments map() method. applies provided function specified first parameter each element iterable. Code Python program print Python list without brackets using join() map() function Creating list numbers Using join() function print(', '.join(map(str, numbers))) Output: map() method used instance above typecast each item list into string datatype, which later combined with commas.
