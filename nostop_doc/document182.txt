next prev Python Array List Python array lists important data structure Python. Both list array list used store data Python. These data structures allow indexing, slicing, iterating. they have little dissimilarity with each other. this tutorial, will learn essential difference between Python list array. Introduction know that, Python extensive data structures such lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries that provide many features functions. lists most effective easy-to-use data structure Python. other hand, Python doesn't provide built-in support array. need import array module array module from NumPy package Python program. that's primary difference between array list. Before diving deep into this topic, let's have brief introduction both data structures. Python List list built-in, linear data structure Python. used store data sequence manner. perform several operations list, such indexing, iterating, slicing. list comes with following features. list elements enclosed with square bracket, each element separated comma (,). mutable type which means modify list items after their creation. lists ordered, which means items stored specific order. indexing access list element. store items different data types. combine strings, integers, objects same list. Below example list. Example list [31, print(list) print(type(list)) Output: [31, <class 'list'> Example creating list containing elements belonging different data types list1 [1,"Yash",['a','e']] print(list1) Output: 'Yash', ['a', 'e']] above list, first element integer; second string third list characters. Array Python array also linear data structure that stores data. also ordered, mutable, enclosed square brackets. store non-unique items. there restrictions store different data type values. work with Array Python, need import either array module Numpy. import array import numpy Elements allocated contiguous memory location that allows easy modification, addition, deletion, accessing element. Moreover, need specify data type. Let's understand following example. Example Import array array_1 arr.array("i", [31, 60,19, 12]) print(array_1) print(type(array_1)) Output: array('i', [31, 12]) <class 'array.array'> Example Using Numpy array import numpy array_sample np.array(["str", 'sunil', 'sachin', 'megha', 'deepti']) print (array_sample) print(type(array_sample)) Output: ['numbers' 'sunil' 'sachin' 'megha' 'deepti'] <class 'numpy.ndarray'> have specified string type stored string value. Difference between Array List Now, have brief introduction features. Here, will discuss differences between Array List. List Array list store value different types. only consist value same type. list cannot handle direct arithmetic operations. directly handle arithmetic operations. need import array before work with array. lists build-in data structure don't need import lists less compatible than array store data. array much compatible than list. consumes large memory. more compact memory size comparatively list. suitable storing longer sequence data item. suitable storing shorter sequence data items. print entire list using explicit looping. print entire list without using explicit looping. nested contain different types elements. must contain either nested elements same size. Conclusion have discussed differences between array list. Both data types essential Python both have some limitations. Python lists easy python where arrays typically used data analysis.
