next prev Popular Python Framework Build Python most versatile programming language, allows perform complex tasks easily. this tutorial, will learn about Python framework widely used build APIs. Before that, let's understand what works. What API? acronym Application Programming Interface. software intermediary that enables communication between applications. example purchase product from online shopping portal make payment using API. Let's take real-world example, suppose restaurant with menu ready give order. Kitchen like "system" that will prepare your ordered food, Kitchen knows what have ordered communicate with chef make your order. Here waiter comes waiter will take your request Kitchen system will prepare food. Then waiter will deliver food back response. Frameworks Build There number frameworks available them meant API. Below some popular important frameworks. Django Rest Framework Django REST powerful Django-based framework that developer uses create APIs. Django REST, REST stands Representational State Transfer. used web-based architecture data communication. HTTP request used call between machines. There four standard methods used Django REST framework GET, PUT, POST, DELETE. provides simplest create rich APIs. install Django REST framework using command. work with Django REST framework, Python version should 3.5+, Django must installed system. Django REST Features Huge active community across world. trusted organization such Hat, Mozilla, Heroku. also provides support testing, debugging caching. Automatic support routing Django. takes less code build complex API. Drawbacks There vast numbers default tools that make difficult learn newbies. programs into problem while packaging components lack proper guidance. Flask REST Framework Flask REST framework same Django REST framework. used build quickly. Flask known doing lightweight project, requires lines code build API. With help this framework, developer easily create API, many features adding Flask REST framework. Flask RESTful Features Flask very lightweight framework easy install. provides default security threats like injection attacks, data integrity checks, etc. Offers facility custom fields input based data type. comes with representation() decorator that support other representations XML, CSV, HTML. marsal_with() decorator used data formatting. Drawbacks can't used larger projects. However, Flask highly flexible; early customization time delay expansion production. Falcon Falcon high-performance framework that used build large-scale application backbends microservices. develop using object-oriented class-based interface. highly compatible with multiple servers. Kurt Griffiths developed Falcon 2013. Through, there extensive community provides valuable input. follows HTTP REST architecture style that used create clear designs. This framework concerned with quality control. Falcon Features lightweight requires minimal setup. provides rapid development. Integrated with NoSQL Comes with build-in server debugger development. Provides fast performance. Drawbacks suitable HTML pages. Lack built-in server. documentation less comprehensive than other frameworks like django flask. Pyramid Pyramid hybrid framework that acts bridge between Django Flask. used both types projects, neither small. Django follows Pyramid's progress social media Twitter Google Group. Pyramid's developers continuously working towards development; they released tenth release since debut. current version Pyramid 1.10. Pyramid Features Pyramid used file building, thus packaging foolproof manner. provides safety net, especially newcomers. supports versions Python. allows developers robust API, mapping, high extensibility ons. Users create fairly sizeable project template. Pyramid comes with bootstrapping tool called pcreate which compatible with numerous templates based SQLAlchemy ZODB. Drawbacks template syntax relatively complicated. XHTML structuring seem foreign complex, migrating from Django. FastAPI name suggests, FastAPI fastest high-performing Python framework building APIs. This framework develop 300% times faster. community growing significantly. based ASGI, which majorly used building asynchronous applications. Interactive documentation Minimize duplication code. highly secure built-in authentication. Unlimited support plugins. There intuitive editor support (VSCode/PyCharm) with auto completion. Drawbacks takes time request validation. Crowded main file. singleton Dependency Injection. framework built Flask Cerberus. makes development simple fast. create REST services effortlessly, which customizable. generally used mid-sized project. Nicola Iarocci developed this framework early 2013, been updated times since debut. Features default, supports filtering, sorting, resource pagination, HATEOAS. supports full range CRUD operations. Supports CORS, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. comes with advanced features such Databases, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Neo4js. Drawbacks suitable mid-level projects; can't handle large project. takes time hunt down suitable extension. CherryPy Cherry minimalist framework, object-oriented HTTP/1.1 compliant. primary CherryPy provide speedy development. shrinks source codebases. developed Remi Delon released 2002. Now, maintained CherryPy community. CherryPy mailing list. Leading video streaming company Netflix CherryPy build block select projects. CherryPy Features Object-oriented programming cuts development time also codebase size. comes with built-in tools authentication, static content, caching, session. server both dynamic user-dependent content well. provides built-in support JSON. Drawbacks Sessions enabled default. User with permission access file, page handlers written properly. Cornice cornice REST framework Pyramid, which offers helper build REST services. takes care HTTP specifications automated where possible. Cornice Features provides three fields messages sender, content, color, (red black). Adding message done authentication. path cornice equal service. Supports prefixing your routes. Drawback Single channel available messages. user with same name already registered, he/she cannot register. messages users stored memory. Conclusion This tutorial included most used popular frameworks that widely used create APIs. Each framework merits demits user choose them according their requirements.
