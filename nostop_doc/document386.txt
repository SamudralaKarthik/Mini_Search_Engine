next prev Python PyLab Module While performing some tasks, have graphs like line charts, graphs, etc., many reasons like make task more interactive, pass information very interesting way, graphs easy self-explanatory, etc. That's plotting graph chart very important integrated part many functions. Graphs charts play very important role field programming, developers always recommended using graphs their programs. Therefore, becomes very important that should aware plot graphs from program. MATLAB considered best plot graphs charts, possible everyone MATLAB plotting graphs charts. have many interactive modules present Python that allow plot graphs charts output, here will talk about module, which provides MATLAB-like namespace importing functions. will talk about PyLab Module Python this tutorial, will learn plot graphs chart output using functions this module program. PyLab Module Python PyLab Python package that provides namespace Python programming, which very similar MATLAB interface, importing functions from Python Numpy Matplotlib Module. talk about these modules' role PyLab package, Matplotlib Module provides functions that help create visualizations data, whereas Numpy Module provides efficient numerical vector calculation functions that based underlying Fortran binary libraries. will learn about PyLab Module this section, will then plot some basic graphs charts using elements functions which this module provides PyLab Module: Introduction PyLab Module associated module with Matplotlib Module Python, gets installed alongside when installing Matplotlib Module system. also that PyLab procedural interface Matplotlib Module, object-oriented plotting library Python. PyLab itself convincing module because bulky import NumPy Module's functions matplotlib.pyplot package single namespace provide MATLAB-like namespace. PyLab Module: Installation have already discussed, PyLab Module gets installed alongside installation Matplotlib package. Still, want this module Python program, should make sure that Matplotlib Module present system. Matplotlib present system, then following installer command command prompt terminal shell install Matplotlib Module PyLab Module with install matplotlib Other than this, have also discussed that PyLab Module also uses mathematical vector operation functions from Numpy Module. Therefore, have make sure that Numpy Module also present system, installed, then following command install numpy module from command prompt terminal: install numpy have installed requisite libraries PyLab Module, PyLab Module Python programs plot graphs charts from functions. PyLab Module: Implementation Here, will functions PyLab Module plot simple curves graphs using them inside Python program understand implementation. will first start with basic plotting curves, then will some advanced functions make plotted graphs curves more interactive. Basic plotting with PyLab Module: Plotting curves using PyLab Module Python program requires plot command, this command takes pair arrays sequences having same length. Let's understand this implementation through example program. Example: Look following Python program from which will plot basic curve output: Importing from Numpy from numpy import Importing from PyLab from pylab import X-axis curve linspace(-4, Y-axis curve a**2 Plotting curve with y-axis plot(a, Showing curve output show() Output: Explanation: have first imported functions from Numpy PyLab Module them program plotting curve output. After that, have defined Y-axis curve variable, respectively. Then, used plot() function provided variables arguments. last, used show() function display curve plotted output. output that curve displayed with Y-axis points, have defined inside variables, respectively. Advance Plotting with PyLab Module: some arguments plot() function along with variable arguments providing inside plot more interactive curves using PyLab Module. have provide additional string arguments inside plot() function print symbol lines instead straight line curves. understand this using additional argument following example program: Example Look following Python program where will plot curve output having symbols, using PyLab Module: Importing from Numpy from numpy import Importing from PyLab from pylab import X-axis curve linspace(-4, Y-axis curve Plotting curve with variable plot(a, '^') Showing curve output show() Output: Explanation: After importing functions from both Numpy PyLab Module program, have defined variables Y-axis curve, respectively. After that, have used plot() function, inside plot function, have provided additional argument symbol with variable show curve with symbol instead simple straight line. output that curve displayed with Y-axis points, have defined inside variable, respectively, symbol instead straight line. following symbols argument inside plot() function want print symbol line instead straight line curve: Symbols ., ,, -., --. Other than this, want, also print lines with other colors than default color plotted output curve, performing this task, have follow same instructions. have color argument additional argument inside plot() function that line curve printed output will printed color choice. understand this using additional argument following example program: Example Look following Python program where will plot curve output having colorful line, using PyLab Module: Importing from Numpy from numpy import Importing from PyLab from pylab import X-axis curve linspace(-4, Y-axis curve Plotting curve with variable plot(a, 'y') Showing curve output show() Output: Explanation: have used same logic this program have used program given previous example. have used color argument plot() function this program print curve having colorful line output. Last, used show() function display curve with customized variable output. output that curve displayed with Y-axis points, have defined inside variable, respectively, yellow color line because have given additional color argument plot() function. following color codes additional argument inside plot() function want print straight line having choice color curve: Colour codes Now, wonder whether perform both operation (printing symbol line instead straight line printing with color choice) simultaneously not, answer yes. perform both task simultaneously, just have provide both arguments together single additional argument like '_y' inside plot() function. Then, will perform both operations simultaneously, curve having symbol line with color choice will printed output. understand this using additional argument following example program: Example Look following Python program where will plot curve output using PyLab Module: Importing from Numpy from numpy import Importing from PyLab from pylab import X-axis curve linspace(-3, Y-axis curve Plotting curve with variable plot(a, 'm+') Showing curve output show() Output: output, have printed curve having colorful symbol line output. last, also print multiple curves inside overlaid them under single plot that just have multiple plot() functions together program. understand this method through using multiple plot() function following example program: Example Look following Python program where have used plot() function multiple times overlaid curve: Importing from Numpy from numpy import Importing from PyLab from pylab import Defining multiple variables multiple plot() function linspace(2, linspace(1, linspace(3, Using plot() function multiple times plot(a, 'y-') plot(b, 'c--') plot(c, 'g.') Showing curve output show() Output: output that have plotted multiple curves overlaid them using plot() function multiple times program. Conclusion have learned about PyLab Module this tutorial, where learned that PyLab Module provides MATLAB-like namespace, very helpful plotting multipurpose curves using Python program. have plotted multiple types curves output importing functions from PyLab Numpy Module program. After starting with basic plotting, plotted curves having symbol line or/and color line, overlaid curves. Next TopicWorking with files Python prev next
