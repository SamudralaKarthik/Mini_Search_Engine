next prev Linear Search Python Python most popular powerful languages. takes lines execute code, which makes much user-friendly language. this tutorial, will learn linear search Python. Searching technique find particular element present given list. There types searching Linear Search Binary Search Both techniques widely used search element given list. What Linear Search? Linear search method finding elements within list. also called sequential search. Â It simplest searching algorithm because searches desired element sequential manner. compares each every element with value that searching for. both matched, element found, algorithm returns key's index position. Concept Linear Search Let's understand following steps find element given list. Step Start search from first element Check with each element list Step element found, return index position key. Step element found, return element present. Linear Search Algorithm There list elements value searched. Below linear search algorithm. LinearSearch(list, key) each item list item value return index position return Python Program Let's understand following Python implementation linear search algorithm. Program linear_Search(list1, key): Searching list1 sequentially range(0, (list1[i] key): return return list1 ,3, len(list1) linear_Search(list1, key) if(res -1): print("Element found") else: print("Element found index: res) Output: Element found index: Explanation: above code, have created function linear_Search(), which takes three arguments list1, length list, number search. defined loop iterate each element compare value. element found, return index else return which means element present list. Linear Search Complexity Time complexity linear search algorithm Base Case O(1) Average Case O(n) Worst Case -O(n) Linear search algorithm suitable smaller list (<100) because check every element desired number. Suppose there 10,000 element list desired element available last position, this will consume much time comparing with each element list. fast result, binary search algorithm. have discussed basic concept linear search. next tutorial, will learn second most popular searching algorithm named Binary search.
