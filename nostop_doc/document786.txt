next prev Numpy-3d Matrix Multiplication What Matrix? matrix programming also considered multi-dimensional array. matrix dimension, such two-dimensional matrix, three-dimensional matrix etc. create two-dimensional matrix arranging many one-dimensional arrays (stack one-dimensional arrays). same way, create three-dimensional array stacking two-dimensional array matrix third direction. arithmetic operation matrix same dimension, like addition, subtraction multiplication. cannot operations matrix different dimensions. multiply three-dimensional (3-d) matrices python using numpy library. Numpy library python programming language which used operations arrays. represent three-dimensional matrix size (i,j,k), which means there number two-dimensional matrices arranged, each two-dimensional matrix dimension size jxk. know multiply matrices, follow RXC rule which column number first matrix should equal other number second matrix. Example: #importing numpy library main file import numpy np.random.seed(96) #creating random three-dimensional matrix matrix1 np.random.randint(0, size=(3, matrix2 np.random.randint(0, size=(3, #printing both matrix with their sizes print("matrix1:\n{}, size={}\nmatrix2:\n{}, size={}".format( matrix1, matrix1.shape, matrix2, matrix2.shape)) #multiplying matrices storing them third matrix result np.matmul(matrix1, matrix2) #printing result print("Muliplication result:\n{}, size={}".format(result, result.shape)) Output: Explanation: above program, have matrices, implemented matrix multiplication using numpy library. imported humpy library file functions. random.randInt function, which will create matrix given size with value range provided. size first matrix 3x5x2 random number which means there three matrices size 5x2 size. same way, created second matrix size 3x2x5 random number which means there three matrices size size. Since column number first matrix's matrix same number second matrix's matrix, multiply matrices easily using R-C multiplication rule. matrix multiplication, used inbuilt matmul function numpy library. Since there three matrices, resultant, there also will three matrices. size two-dimensional matrix would 5x5. finally, size resultant matrix will 3x5x5. resultant matrix, first matrix matrix1 will multiplied with first matrix matrix2, same way, matrices will multiplied. result[0] matrix1[0]X matrix2[0] result[1] matrix1[1]X matrix2[1] result[2] matrix1[2]X matrix2[2] Note: size two-dimensional matrices same then there will error: Example #importing numpy library main file import numpy np.random.seed(96) #creating random three-dimensional matrix matrix1 np.random.randint(0, size=(3, matrix2 np.random.randint(0, size=(4, #printing both matrix with their sizes print("matrix1:\n{}, size={}\nmatrix2:\n{}, size={}".format( matrix1, matrix1.shape, matrix2, matrix2.shape)) #multiplying matrices storing third matrix result np.matmul(matrix1, matrix2) #printing result print("Muliplication result:\n{}, size={}".format(result, result.shape)) Output: Explanation: above code, size matrix matrix1 matrix2, 3x5, will multiplied, above compilation error. Note: number matrices same, then there also will error program. Example #importing numpy library main file import numpy np.random.seed(96) #creating random three-dimensional matrix matrix1 np.random.randint(0, size=(3, matrix2 np.random.randint(0, size=(6, #printing both matrix with their sizes print("matrix1:\n{}, size={}\nmatrix2:\n{}, size={}".format( matrix1, matrix1.shape, matrix2, matrix2.shape)) #multiplying matrices storing into third matrix result np.matmul(matrix1, matrix2) #printing result print("Muliplication result:\n{}, size={}".format(result, result.shape)) Output: Explanation: above code, number matrices matrix1 three, matrix2, there will error unequal size.
