next prev __file__ Special Variable) Python What Special variables? Python, there some variables which defined using double underscores, they called Dunder magic methods. They used special purposes code, that they referred special variables. example: __init__ __add__ ,__len__ ,__file__ etc. __init__ method: This method called without function call, invoked when create object instance class. other programming languages, called constructor. __file__ method: Python code, import many files modules current code reuse same code increase efficiency. This method contains path module which have imported into file some special purpose. type this variable would string, empty non-empty. module which have imported present database, system then there would path that module, this variable would empty. module present local system then there would definitely path module, will stored this variable. value this variable would determined import system python. will some examples understand different case scenarios this variable. Example1: Python code: test.py Creating first module named HelloWorld will this module function other modules helloWorld(): 	print("This imported from HelloWorld thanks javatpoint test2.py Importing above created module hello world import test Calling method created inside test module test.helloWorld() printing __file__variableto path module print(test.__file__) Output: Explanation: above code, have module named test.py, where have defined method which will print some statements. Then created second module named test2.py, which have imported test.py module. method test.py test2.py, print __file__ variable first module. path test.py module using this special variable. Example2: will import more than module same file. Python code: test1.py Creating first module named HelloWorld1 will this module function other modules helloWorld1(): 	print("This module named test thanks javatpoint test3.py Creating first module named HelloWorld3 will this module function other modules helloWorld3(): 	print("This module named test3 thanks javatpoint test4.py Creating first module named HelloWorld4 will this module function other modules helloWorld4(): 	print("This module named test4 thanks javatpoint test2.py Importing above created modules hello world import test1 import test3 import test4 Calling method created inside test module printing __file__variableto path module test1.helloWorld1() print(test1.__file__) test3.helloWorld3() print(test3.__file__) test4.helloWorld4() print(test4.__file__) Output: Explanation: above code, have three different modules named test1,test3, test4, where have defined some methods. have another module which main module file where have imported three modules. have used __file__ special variable each module path each respective module. Example3: modules present different folders: Python code: add.py #defining function, which will used other modules addNumber(a,b): print("the numbers ",a+b) test2.py Importing above created modules hello world from javatpoint import Calling method created inside test module add.addNumber(6,63) printing __file__variableto path module print(add.__file__) Output: Explanation: above code, have module named add.py, which method numbers. have main module named test2.py, which have imported module, then have used addNumber method module current module. have used __file__ special variable module, which will print exact path module.
