next prev Spell Corrector using Tkinter Python When write letters, emails, etc., commit spelling errors, what call typos. Even while writing this piece, many errors were made. that, these situations, rely assistants some applications. know that using Python, create system your spelling going through easy steps? this Python Spell Corrector Application, will follow this example only. Python programme called Spell Corrector, often known Spell Checker, determines word right spelling not. this Python project, we'll build spell checker corrector that input word produce term that sounds close Python provides variety choices development (Graphical User Interface). Tkinter approach used most frequently among approaches. fastest simplest approach construct apps with Python Tkinter. This article will provide step-by-step tutorial develop Spell Corrector application using Tkinter. Let's going! Spell Corrector Application goal Spell Corrector identify terms that similar word that entered. list terms that most closely resemble input word shown spell checker entry box. same term shown input word correct. locate terms that comparable input words clicking button present screen. Details about Python Spell Checker project application's goal will develop spell-correcting application. There will programme. We'll include place entering term GUI. When button pressed, terms that most similar input word will displayed entry box. Requisites Project We'll utilising Python TextBlob Tkinter libraries develop this project. gathering user's input displaying output depending entered spelling built using Tkinter module. we'll TextBlob module this check. When creating this module, previous Python Tkinter module expertise would beneficial. following commands used install modules shown just below. install tkinter install textblob Steps followed develop Python Spell Corrector Every project needs step-by-step flow from developer make work easier. will talk about this Python project flows. import TextBlob Tkinter modules first. Next, develop incorporate necessary widgets. Finally, create function that verifies spelling outputs appropriate results. let's started. Importing Tkinter TextBlob modules importing required modules into program from tkinter import from textblob import TextBlob Tkinter TextBlob modules were imported from standard Python library used code. Tkinter module will used creating window adding widgets application TextBlob module will used correcting incorrect word provided user. Creating functions that verifies spelling outputs correct result Creating method clear data from entry boxes clrAll() Deleting data inside entry boxes word1_place.delete(0, END) word2_place.delete(0, END) Here, first created clrAll() method clear text from entry containing texts from previous entries. This done using delete() method entry boxes word1_place word2_place, emptying entry boxes. Creating method corrected word crction() getting word input from user entry input_wrd word1_place.get() creating TextBlob obj. blob_objct TextBlob(input_wrd) getting corrected word incorrect word crctd_word str(blob_objct.correct()) applying insert method insertion value into data entry box. word2_place.insert(10, crctd_word) Then, created function called crction() order display correct word entry box. Along with that, input word from user stored input_wrd variable. Then using TextBlob object created stored variable blob_objct. Next, blob_objct used correct wrong word stored variable crctd_word. finally, corrected word displayed entry allotted help insert() method. Develop incorporate necessary widgets Main code __name__ "__main__" Creating Graphical User Interface (GUI) window with Tkinter instance base Tk() Setting colour background window base.configure(background 'light green') Setting dimensions window Width Height base.geometry("400x150") Alotting name window base.title("Spell Corrector") Then, created window, creating instance object Tkinter module. Then used configure() method order colour background window light green. also used geometry() method which helped dimensions window displayed screen. Lastly, with help title() method, were able give title window created "Spell Corrector" Creating heading label Welcome Spell Corrector Application headlbl Label(base text 'Welcome Spell Corrector Application' 'black' "red") Creating another label word entered, "Input Word" lbl1 Label(base text "Input Word" 'black' 'dark green') Creating another label corrected word shown, "Corrected Word" lbl2 Label(base text "Corrected Word" 'black' 'dark green') Next, started creating labels. First all, created heading label application using label() method stored variable headlbl. various specifications this label were using keyword text provide display text, give text colour black give background colour red. Then, created another label, input word using label() method that stored variable lbl1. various specifications this label also were using keyword text, similar previous label. lastly, created another label, corrected word displayed, using label() method that stored variable lbl2. various specifications this label also were using keyword text, similar previous label. grid functions used positioning widgets certain places tabular arrangement padx keyword used setting padding along x-axis headlbl.grid(row column lbl1.grid(row column lbl2.grid(row column padx Creating entry boxes entering words required text word1_place Entry() word2_place Entry() padx keyword used setting padding along x-axis pady keyword used setting padding along y-axis word1_place.grid(row column padx pady word2_place.grid(row column padx pady Then, used grid() method order position created labels appropriately, mention row, col, padx, padding along x-axis. After that, created entry boxes word1_place word2_place using Entry() method. Here, word1_place used entering word user word2_place used display corrected word user entered word. These boxes were also positioned appropriately using grid() method along with keywords row, col, padx pady. Creating variable Correction Button work getting clicked calling correction method event trigger btn1 Button(base text "Correction" "red" "black" command crction) btn1.grid(row column Creating another button clear existing text being called using clrAll method btn2 Button(base text "Clear" "red" "black" command clrAll) btn2.grid(row column Next, created buttons, btn1 btn2, event triggers. btn1 used show corrected word user entered word btn2 used clear entry boxes before entering word. Both these buttons were positioned using grid() method along with keywords like text, command. command keyword used call previously created function after clicking buttons, triggering function.
