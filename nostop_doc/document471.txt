next prev Python Libraries Learn 2022 programming world, Python most demanded efficient programming language. There many reasons that make Python much-demanded language. thing that attracts people incredible extensibility. Python provides thousands libraries which reduces number lines. Python huge community worldwide, community been continuously updating features libraries. this tutorial, will discuss Python libraries that launched earlier. haven't listed typical libraries that everybody knows (pandas, pytorch, numpy, Tensorflow). Awkward Array AugLy Gradily Jupytext Evidently LightBGM Django Ninja SQLModel Scalene Bonus Library Jina Finetuner Python Libraries listing some Python libraries that quite popular upcoming years provide scale career. Below libraries Python that newly launched. Awkward Array Most might familiar with numpy array. That main data structure numpy grid value. Numpy array allows vectorized operations over data part, which influences parallelism optimization low-level libraries. Hence, they execute much faster than Python loop. Numpy arrays lack expressing variable-length structures. Although, dtype object, this enough. this scenario, Awkward library help Awkward arrays might seem like regular array underneath; they nested, tree-like data structures (JSON). They similar Numpy arrays, such storing data contiguous memory. They operated using compiled, vectorized code. take reference from official documentation awkward library. Let's understand following example Example import awkward ak array ak.Array([ [{"x": 1.1, "y": [1]}, {"x": 2.2, "y": 2]}, {"x": 3.3, "y": 3]}], [{"x": 4.4, "y": 4]}, {"x": 5.5, "y": 5]}] Using regular Python loop import numpy output sublist array: tmp1 record sublist: tmp2 number record["y"][1:]: tmp2.append(np.square(number)) tmp1.append(tmp2) output.append(tmp1) Output:1 [[[], [4], 9]], [[4, 16], 25]]] Using Awkward Array output np.square(array["y", ..., 1:]) print(output) Output:2 [[[], [4], 9]], [[4, 16], 25]]] see, both code snippets have generated same output, second took single line. much faster uses less memory. Gradio belong data science field, must familiar with Streamlight. Streamlight enables data scripts into shareable apps that user demo their output actual app, Jupiter Notebook. Grades fastest demo machine learning model with friendly interface. makes demo builder easier faster than Streamlight. Radio allows create specific machine learning model. Users modify application changing parameters using sliders, uploading images, writing text, recording voice. doubt, Gradio makes model more accessible, which most important data scientist. There general perception; usually, data scientists spend most their time tuning models planning about best approach novel problems. That wrong; Data Scientist spends most their time fetching data, arranging incorrect format, writing boilerplate code. infrastructure code also essential deal with important qualities data. dataset format with simple used store, create collaborate datasets size. store dataset without worrying about data size. used many tech giants like Google, Waymo, Oxford University, Cross, Omdena. comes with build-in integration Pytorch Tensorflow. stores data compressed format (chucked arrays). also store storage option such bucket, consider local storage. works lazily means data only fetched when needed. main advantages that don't need multi-TB work with multi-TB datasets. AugLy AugLy used train robust models computer vision. Getting most important insight from labeled data very important. Moreover, data augmented core various disciplines that have greatly advanced SOTA 2021. AugLy invented Meta (Facebook), data augmentations library that currently supports four modalities (audio, image, text, video) more than augmentations. configure augmentations with metadata compress them desired result. AugLy library designed utilize augmenting data model training. There many other libraries flipping, resizing, color jittering. Let's take real-life example library Turn image into meme, overlay text/emojis images/videos, change some images into Instagram filter, etc. jupytext Jupyter notebook very useful tool, don't want write data browser. demerit Jupyter notebook. Moreover, also creates problems version control. Jupytext eliminates such limitations allows save notebooks markdowns scripts several languages. provides result plain text, making easy share them version control. Other people merge changes even IDEs their nice autocomplete. must-have tool data scientist 2022. Evidently team engineers data scientists creates machine learning model model receives sends data effortlessly. time production, many things wrong. This happen many reasons. open-source Python package used estimate explore data drift machine learning models. Instead detecting anomalies data, helps detect data drift target drift. helps evaluate models during validation monitor them production. Evidently, generate visual reports that data scientists cross-check ensure everything working fine. LightGBM LightGBM most effective gradient-boosting machine learning framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. allows programmers redefined elementary models decision trees develop algorithms. Many other libraries, such XGBoost CatBoost, apply same approach, LightGBM comes with some advanced advantages. offers optimal speed memory usage gives better accuracy. This library capable large-scale handling data. Django Ninja Django most popular battery-included framework that used build applications. developer wants create RESTful APIs, they move toward Django Rest Framework. there contender known Django Ninja. fast framework building APIs with Django. Django Ninja provides straightforward create APIs where type casting validation parameters. used multiple companies live projects. also integrated with Django that easily take advantage Python/Django. SQLModel SQLModel library that interacts with database using Python code with Python objects. based Python annotations supported Pydantic SQLAlchemy. provides great support editors takes them less time debugging. This library quite easy user-friendly. main advantage that; excellent compatibility with FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy. familiar with basic knowledge databases, easily known with this library. Scalene Scalene high-performing memory GPU/CPU profiler integrated that several things. equipped handle multi-threaded code delivers better details than other profilers. While using don't need make changes script execute script from scalene command. simply gives result form HTML document text track memory used each line code. Bonus Library Jina Finetuner Most using search engines like Google, have ever noticed search engines getting better than they were years ago. Something revolutionary happens behind scene that slowly replacing traditional keyword-based search. searching known Neural Search. neural search feeds entire text neural networks, which turns into vectors. simplify, keyword-based search, texts spat into discrete tokens used that matching. neural search won't only limit text data. implemented with data type (images, audio, video). Jina comes with revolutionary solution that empowers developers build scalable deep learning search applications minutes. provides facility implement neural search systems, both from code deployment perspective. scalable cloud-native. other hand, Fine tuner allows fine-tune neural network representation fetch most appropriate results neural search tasks. Conclusion There several other popular useful libraries could milestones tech fields. have explained important, common libraries which widely used near future. Python most common language used Data science activities. Most mentioned tools would used Python expert enhance product quality. Next TopicReading NetCDF Data using Python prev next
