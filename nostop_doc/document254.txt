next prev Check Python version Python interpreter commercially used throughout many industries source coding, computer programming, code testing. takes commands from user executes them after interpreting them. Hence, becomes very important know about version Python interpreter that currently using. know that interpreter which takes code from user executes line line. Sometimes, suppose have older version Python interpreter. that case, makes command doesn't execute appropriately because older version interpreter incompatibility with functions used command. know that Python programming language that comes with regular update that adds some features functions with therefore, user, also have regularly update Python interpreter with latest released version Note: latest version Python interpreter '3.9.6' with stable version. Benefits checking Python interpreter's version: Following some highlighted benefits checking version Python interpreter using: will know missing update interpreter updates function comes with find syntax error producing because older version Python interpreter. have access latest functions updates that come with latest version Python interpreter. Checking Version Python interpreter this section, will learn about methods which quickly check version Python interpreter using. even check Python interpreter version using Python program. will also command prompt method check Python interpreter version using. Following methods checking version Python interpreter that going learn this tutorial: With python_version() function With python command With sys.version method Let's understand that these methods Python well command prompt terminal check Python interpreter's version. Method Using python_version() function: this function checking version Python interpreter, first have import platform library. python_version() function always returns version interpreter string format. better understand about working this, let's this Python program. Look following program: Example Importing platform library from platform import python_version Getting Python interpreter version result print("Current Version Python interpreter using-", python_version()) Output: Current Version Python interpreter using- 3.9.0 Explanation above output, using '3.9.0' version Python interpreter. also this function command prompt terminal check version interpreter. using python_version() function terminal, have adhere following steps: Step Open terminal shell system. Step Write 'python' press enter enter into Python shell. Step Now, write above code line line inside terminal then press enter key. terminal will show version interpreter output code following: Method Using python command: Using 'python command considered simplest easiest method checking version Python interpreter using. inbuilt command command prompt shell, this method specially built command prompt shell checking Python version. this method, only have follow following steps: Step Open terminal shell present device. Step Write following command shell press enter: 'python Now, will version Python interpreter using string format. Method Using sys.version method: sys.version method checking version Python interpreter, first have import platform library. Like python_version() function method, this method both command prompt shell well Python program Python shell. Here, will only this method Python program version Python interpreter output program. Look following program: Example Importing library import Getting interpreter version result print("Current Version Python interpreter using-" sys.version) Output: Current Version Python interpreter using- 3.9.0 (tags/v3.9.0:9cf6752, 2020, 15:34:40) [MSC v.1927 (AMD64)] output that have version interpreter using string format, have also released date interpreter version this sys.version method.
