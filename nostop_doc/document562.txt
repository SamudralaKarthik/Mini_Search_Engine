next prev Python Program Find Difference between Strings this tutorial, will write Python program find difference between given strings. This problem asked interview. Let's understand problem statement then will approach solution. Problem Statement There strings given String generated random shuffling string then added more character random position. need write Python program that returns letter added Example Input: "zxyc", "zxyce" Output: Explanation: letter that added. Example Input: "uvw", "wyu" Output: Explanation: letter that added. Constraints: following constraints should followed s.length 1000 t.length s.length consist lowercase English letters. Python Program Let's understand following Python program. Example class Solution(object): findTheDifference(self, ls_s [s[i] range(len(s))] ls_t [t[i] range(len(t))] elem ls_s: ls_t.remove(elem) return(ls_t[0]) Solution() "zxyc" "zxyce" print(obj.findTheDifference(s, Output: Explanation above code, defined findThedifference() function that takes strings arguments. used list comprehension convert strings into list. Now, iterate ls_s list, pick single element remove that element second list ls_t. element removed from second element, means both given strings same, otherwise return first element second list. Solution Let's another solution problem. class Solution: findTheDifference(self, str, str) str: #sort both strings s_list sorted(s) t_list sorted(t) s_list.append(0) make length equal else will list index bounds extra char string2) range(len(t_list)): s_list[i] t_list[i]: character same both strings, answer return t_list[i] Solution() "zxyc" "zxyce" print(obj.findTheDifference(s, Output: Explanation this tutorial, used sorted() method, which converts string into list characters sorted manner. created lists strings added extra element make length equal; else, will list index bounds. iterated t_list checked s_list element equal t_list; condition matched, returns that element.
