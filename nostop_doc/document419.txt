ChemPy Module Python: Implementation Now, moving ahead with implementation chempy module, applications functions perform many chemical analyses solve many chemistry problems through Python program. will only following applications chempy module this tutorial understand this module's implementation: Getting number elements from periodic table Getting properties formula given chemical substance will Python program each application listed above print required result output understand implementation chempy module. Application Getting number elements from periodic table: required number elements with their properties, such atomic mass, symbol, etc., output using period table functions from chempy module program. will understand implementation this application through following example program, where will print number elements with their properties output. Example Look following program where have printed elements from periodic table output: Importing chempy module from chempy.util import periodic prd Number elements from user int(input("Enter number elements which want fetch from periodic table: print("Printing", num, "elements from periodic table") Displaying periodic element information print("Atomic No.\tName\t\tSymbol\t\tMass") Using loop loop over periodic table range(1, Printing atomic number elements 	print(a, "\t\t") Displaying names elements len(prd.names[a]) 		print(prd.names[a], "\t") 	else: 		print(prd.names[a], "\t\t") Printing element symbol 	print(prd.symbols[a], "\t\t") Displaying atomic mass element 	print(prd.relative_atomic_masses[a]) print("Result periodic elements printed according number provided") Output: Enter number elements which want fetch from periodic table: Printing elements from periodic table Atomic No.	Name		Symbol		Mass 1		Helium		He		4.002602 2		Lithium		Li		6.94 3		Beryllium	Be		9.0121831 4		Boron		B		10.81 5		Carbon		C		12.011 6		Nitrogen	N		14.007 7		Oxygen		O		15.999 8		Fluorine	F		18.998403163 9		Neon		Ne		20.1797 10		Sodium		Na		22.98976928 11		Magnesium	Mg		24.305 12		Aluminium	Al		26.9815385 13		Silicon		Si		28.085 14		Phosphorus	P		30.973761998 15		Sulphur		S		32.06 16		Chlorine	Cl		35.45 17		Argon		Ar		39.948 18		Potassium	K		39.0983 19		Calcium		Ca		40.078 20		Scandium	Sc		44.955908 21		Titanium	Ti		47.867 22		Vanadium	V		50.9415 23		Chromium	Cr		51.9961 24		Manganese	Mn		54.938044 Result periodic elements printed according number provided see, list required number elements with their atomic masses symbols printed output. Explanation: have first imported periodic function 'prd' from chempy module program. After that, initialized 'num' variable where take user input value, then will print 'num' number elements. After that, used loop loop over periodic function print required number functions output. used names[a] function print element names, symbols[a] print symbol elements, relative_atomic_masses[a] print their atomic passes. used loop till 'num' number times, then list printed output. Application Getting properties formula given chemical substance: print chemical general properties substance, like formula, html name, etc., using substance functions chempy module. With substance functions, also validate formula given substance with existing formula. will understand implementation this application through following example program: Example Look following Python program where used substance functions chempy ferricyanide: Import chempy module from chempy import Substance Defining chemical formula Ferricyanide elemtentFerriCyanide sst.from_formula('Fe(CN)6-3') Checking chemical formula provided right elemtentFerriCyanide.composition 6}: print("Yes formula Ferricyanide given program right") Printing chemical formula Ferricyanide print("Chemical formula Ferricyanide:", elemtentFerriCyanide.unicode_name) Printing chemical formula Ferricyanide latex form print("Chemical formula Ferricyanide latex name form:", elemtentFerriCyanide.latex_name) Printing chemical formula Ferricyanide html form print("Chemical formula Ferricyanide html name form:", elemtentFerriCyanide.html_name) Printing total mass Ferricyanide print("Atomic mass Ferricyanide compound:", '%.3f' elemtentFerriCyanide.mass) Output: formula Ferricyanide given program right Chemical formula Ferricyanide: Fe(CN)₆³? Chemical formula Ferricyanide latex name form: Fe(CN)_{6}^{3-} Chemical formula Ferricyanide html name form: Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>3-</sup> Atomic mass Ferricyanide compound: 211.955 see, have printed multiple properties ferricyanide output using substance functions chempy module. Explanation: have imported substance from chempy module program. After that, initialized variable ferricyanide taking formula ferricyanide from library. Then, used statement validate given variable's formula actually ferricyanide's chemical formula not.
