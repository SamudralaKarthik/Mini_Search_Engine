next prev Create Calculator using Python following tutorial, will understand create Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator with help Python programming language. started creating one; briefly discuss what Body Mass Index (BMI) Understanding Body Mass Index (BMI) BMI, short Body Mass Index, measure relative weight based mass height individual. generally Body Mass Index order categorize people basis their height weight. These categories underweight, healthy, overweight, even obesity. Moreover, also adopted various countries order promote healthy eating. consider Body Mass Index (BMI) substitute direct measurements body fat. Besides, low-cost easy-to-perform method screening weight classes that cause health-related problems. Understanding working Calculator Calculator accepts weight height individual calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) that person. Example, height weight person kg. that person will 23.73 (approx.), which signifies that person healthy. Body Mass Index (BMI) measure body basis height weight, respectively. basis individual, calculator returns statement stating overall health person. following table shows classification done order identify health status person. Weight Status Below 18.5 Underweight 18.5 24.9 Normal 25.0 29.9 Overweight 30.0 above Obese Now, begin coding project. Creating Calculator using Python first step, will create Python program file name BMI_Calculator.py. Within this file, will begin creating block code user their height weight. easily accomplish this using input() function. File: BMI_Calculator.py asking input from users the_height float(input("Enter height the_weight float(input("Enter weight Explanation: above snippet code, have defined variables the_height the_weight which uses input() function accept input from user. have also included float() function outside input() function order convert input string into float data type that perform calculations with Next, will calculate Body Mass Index. will following formula order calculate BMI. implement above formula Python program. File: BMI_Calculator.py defining function the_BMI the_weight (the_height/100)**2 Explanation: above snippet code, have defined function using above formula. have divided height convert centimeters into meters. Now, print BMI. File: BMI_Calculator.py printing print("Your Body Mass Index is", the_BMI) Explanation: above snippet code, have printed statement stating person. Now, will print statement stating present health user based their BMI. This block code will quite simplified better understanding. will if-elif-else conditions classification. File: BMI_Calculator.py using if-elif-else conditions the_BMI 18.5: print("Oops! underweight.") elif the_BMI 24.9: print("Awesome! healthy.") elif the_BMI 29.9: the_print("Eee! overweight.") else: print("Seesh! obese.") Explanation: above snippet code, have used value variable the_BMI if-elif-else statement check person lies within categories. program will print statement following basis: less than equal 18.5 then program returns condition underweight. less than equal 24.9 then program returns condition Healthy. less than equal 29.9 then program returns condition overweight. none above conditions True then program returns condition obese. Hence, program completed. complete source code program output same. Source Code File: BMI_Calculator.py asking input from users the_height float(input("Enter height the_weight float(input("Enter weight defining function the_BMI the_weight (the_height/100)**2 printing print("Your Body Mass Index is", the_BMI) using if-elif-else conditions the_BMI 18.5: print("Oops! underweight.") elif the_BMI 24.9: print("Awesome! healthy.") elif the_BMI 29.9: the_print("Eee! over weight.") else: print("Seesh! obese.") Output: Enter height Enter weight Your Body Mass Index 23.828124999999996 Awesome! healthy. Next TopicString Binary Python prev next
