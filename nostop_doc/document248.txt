next prev Write Text File using Python this tutorial, will explain users write text file using Python language. Python inbuilt function create, write read files. handle types files normal text files binary files. Normal Text File: text file, every line text terminated with special character known "End Line" (EOL). default, line character ('\n') python. Binary File: binary file, line terminated, data stored after converted into machine binary language. Example: show user write text file using Python) with open ('writeme.txt', 'w') file: file.write('writeme') Steps Used Writing Text File: writing text file using Python, user follow following steps: Step user open text file writing appending using open() function. Step user write text file using write() writelines() function. Step user close text file using close() function. Syntax: open file file open (path_to_the_file, mode) open() function accept various parameters. user focus first two: "path_to_the_file" parameter used specifying path text file that user wants open writing. mode parameter used specifying mode write, read, etc.) which user wants open text file. writing text file, user will following mode: Mode Description used open text file writing text. used opening text file append text. open() function will return file object, file object will have useful functions write text file: write() writelines() write() function used writing string text file, writelines() function used writing list string file once. writelines() function also accept iterable object. user also pass tuple strings, strings, etc. write line text file, user line character manually. Example show user line character Text.txt file file.write('\n') file.writelines('\n') totally user whether they want text following line not. Example show write() function writing list texts text file lines_1 ['Text', 'this example show user write text file using Python'] with open ('text.txt', 'w') file: line_1 lines_1: file.write(line_1) file.write('\n') Output: text.txt file does exist folder, open() function will create file. Example show user write list text strings text.txt file. lines_1 ['Text 2', This example show user write text file using Python'] with open ('text.txt', 'w') file: line_1 lines_1: file.writelines(line_1) Output: user treats each element list line, then they have link with newline character. Example show user link newline character with each element line text.txt file lines_1 ['Text 2.', This example show user write text file using Python.'] with open ('text_2.txt', 'w') file: line_1 lines_1: file.write('\n'.join(lines_1)) Output: Conclusion this tutorial, have explained user write text text file using Python different functions.
