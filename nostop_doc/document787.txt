next prev os.path.abspath() method Python What Module? Python programming language, have module which used various operations related operating system. inbuilt functions, have install this module. path submodule module, which contains some inbuilt functions related operations path names file folder present computer. Example: os.path.dirname(path) supposed return directory name path which have provided argument function. os.path.basename(path) This function supposed return base name path given parameter function. os.path.commonprefix(listOfPaths) This function supposed return common prefix present paths given list. there common prefix then will give empty string output. os.path.exists(path) This function returns Boolean value. given path exists system then will return value true otherwise, will give value false. os.path.lexists(path) This function returns true broken symbols existing path. os.path.getatime(path) returns some floating number which represents number seconds before access file which provided path function argument. file does exist then will give error. os.path.getmtime(path) returns some floating number which represents number seconds before modify file which have provided path function argument. file does exist then will give error. os.path.getsize(path) returns size file bytes. file does exist then will throw error. os.path.splitdrive(path) This function splits path into parts which pass argument. parts drive part tail part. Drive parts denote drive which path exists, like drive drive etc.Tail part remaining part path file. os.path.samefile(path1,path2) This function supposed return true path1 path2 refer same file directory, which passed argument function. path1 path2 denote different files directories then will return false. os.path.splitext(path) This function supposed split given path into parts: first part root second extension. path name, strings characters before period(.) root part, after period(.), extension, including period. there extension then second part will empty. os.path.abspath(path) This function takes path argument, returns normalized pathname given path. returns complete path file system. Syntax: os.path.abspath(path) Return value: absolute pathname given path Example importing os.path module file import os.path file name fileName 'test.py' #print absolute path file print(os.path.abspath(fileName)) Output: Explanation: above code, have tried print absolute path given file. Firstly, have imported os.path module using import keyword. Then, took file name which present current directory which working. have given file name argument os.path.abspath() module, then have printed using print command. Note: change current working directory, then also function. Example #importing module necessary functions import file name fileName './javatpoint/try.png' change current working directory os.chdir("./javatpoint/testingFolder") prints absolute path current working directory with file name print(os.path.abspath(fileName)) Output: Explanation: above code, have imported module inbuilt required functions file. Then have taken file name stored variable. Now, have changed current working directory using function chdir(), which already defined module Python. Now, have used function abspath() absolute name file. print result then that absolute path been changed. Next TopicEmerging Advance Python Projects 2022 prev next
