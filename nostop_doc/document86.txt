There also many separator characters such (\t), colon(:), semi-colon(;), which used separator. Let's understand following example. Here, have example.txt file. name, rollno, Department Peter Parker, 009001, Civil Tony Stark, 009002, Chemical Example Read file example Importing module import open file passing file path. with open(r'C:\Users\DEVANSH SHARMA\Desktop\example.csv') csv_file: csv_read csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',') #Delimeter comma count_line Iterate file object each file csv_read: count_line print(f'Column names ".join(row)}') count_line else: print(f'\t{row[0]} roll number {row[1]} department {row[2]}.') count_line print(f'Processed {count_line} lines.') This line will print number line fro file Output: Column names name, rollnu, Department 	Peter Parker roll number 009001 department Civil. 	Tony Stark roll number 009002 department Chemical. Processed lines. Explanation: above code, imported module read example.csv file. read csv, pass file's full path open() method. used built-in function csv.reader(), takes argument file object delimiter. initialized count_line variable with counts number line from file. Now, iterated each file object. data returned removing delimiters. first returned which contains column names. Next TopicHow Python Program prev next
