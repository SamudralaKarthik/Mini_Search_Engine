next prev POST Requests using Python What HTTP? HTTP stands HyperText Transfer Protocol which some rules which determines communication data transfer into client-server architecture. client generally browser, Server source where information available already, Client requests Server information. server computer where website hosted. client browser sends request server, server responds request client. There methods used HTTP data transfer establishing communication between client server, like GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE, etc. There generally methods used information transfer between client-server: method request POST method request Method method used request server data information. should used with requesting sensitive data, there certain limits requesting data. requests remain browser history, also bookmarked. requests cached. method, should have installed library which supports request like urllib,httplib, requests. install requests library using following command command prompt: install requests same way, install urllib library following command: install urllib3 will discuss some examples request python: Example1: import urllib3 http urllib3.PoolManager() 'https://www.javatpoint.com/sonoo-jaiswal' response http.request('GET', url) print(response.data.decode('utf-8')) Output: Explanation: above code, have first imported urllib3 library file function. Then used PoolManager() function http attribute, http attribute, have method, which takes argument from which requesting data. also pass parameter want from source, request only specific data passing parameter argument. When response from request, decoded into utf-8 printed HTML code given page. POST method POST method used send data server. generally used when want upload data file server, like filling form, etc.POST requests cannot bookmarked, does remain browser history. cannot cached. used with sensitive private data, limit data length. Example2: import urllib3 import certifi http urllib3.PoolManager(ca_certs=certifi.where()) 'https://httpbin.org/POST' request http.request('POST', url, fields={'name': 'Ayush Gupta from iiit kota 2023', 'occupation': 'software engineer'}) print(request.data.decode('utf-8')) Output: Explanation: above code, have used POST method upload some data server website. First all, have imported urllib library code request module POST function. Then took where wanted POST data. Then request module with POST method send data some certain fields. Then printed data received POST request printed. Some important points about POST methods: terms security safety, method considered safe method because send data part URL, there high chance data insecurity. considered sensitive data like passwords etc. only send ASCII character method, whereas there such restriction about data POST method. Since send data section method, there limitation data which being sent, whereas there data size limitation POST method because send data message section. know, send data part method, data becomes part query string appended requesting URL.
