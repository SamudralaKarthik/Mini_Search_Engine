next prev Python If-else statements Decision making most important aspect almost programming languages. name implies, decision making allows particular block code particular decision. Here, decisions made validity particular conditions. Condition checking backbone decision making. python, decision making performed following statements. Statement Description Statement statement used test specific condition. condition true, block code (if-block) will executed. else Statement if-else statement similar statement except fact that, also provides block code false case condition checked. condition provided statement false, then else statement will executed. Nested Statement Nested statements enable else statement inside outer statement. Indentation Python ease programming achieve simplicity, python doesn't allow parentheses block level code. Python, indentation used declare block. statements same indentation level, then they part same block. Generally, four spaces given indent statements which typical amount indentation python. Indentation most used part python language since declares block code. statements block intended same level indentation. will actual indentation takes place decision making other stuff python. statement statement used test particular condition condition true, executes block code known if-block. condition statement valid logical expression which either evaluated true false. syntax if-statement given below. expression: 	statement Example int(input("enter number?")) num%2 print("Number even") Output: enter number?10 Number even Example Program print largest three numbers. int(input("Enter a? ")); int(input("Enter b? ")); int(input("Enter ")); a>c: print("a largest"); b>c: print("b largest"); c>a c>b: print("c largest"); Output: Enter a? Enter b? Enter largest if-else statement if-else statement provides else block combined with statement which executed false case condition. condition true, then if-block executed. Otherwise, else-block executed. syntax if-else statement given below. condition: 	#block statements else: 	#another block statements (else-block) Example Program check whether person eligible vote not. (input("Enter your age? age>=18: print("You eligible vote !!"); else: print("Sorry! have wait !!"); Output: Enter your age? eligible vote Example Program check whether number even not. int(input("enter number?")) num%2 print("Number even...") else: print("Number odd...") Output: enter number?10 Number even elif statement elif statement enables check multiple conditions execute specific block statements depending upon true condition among them. have number elif statements program depending upon need. However, using elif optional. elif statement works like if-else-if ladder statement must succeeded statement. syntax elif statement given below. expression block statements elif expression block statements elif expression block statements else: block statements Example number int(input("Enter number?")) number==10: print("number equals 10") elif number==50: print("number equal 50"); elif number==100: print("number equal 100"); else: print("number equal 100"); Output: Enter number?15 number equal Example marks int(input("Enter marks? marks marks 100: print("Congrats scored grade ...") elif marks marks 85: print("You scored grade ...") elif marks marks 60: print("You scored grade ...") elif (marks marks 40): print("You scored grade ...") else: print("Sorry fail ?")
