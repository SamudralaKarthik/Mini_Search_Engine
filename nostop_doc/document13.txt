next prev Python Loops following loops available Python fulfil looping needs. Python offers choices running loops. basic functionality techniques same, although syntax amount time required checking condition differ. single statement statements repeatedly using loop command. following sorts loops available Python programming language. Sr.No. Name loop Loop Type Description While loop Repeats statement group statements while given condition TRUE. tests condition before executing loop body. loop This type loop executes code block multiple times abbreviates code that manages loop variable. Nested loops iterate loop inside another loop. Loop Control Statements Statements used control loops change course iteration called control statements. objects produced within local scope loop deleted when execution completed. Python provides following control statements. will discuss them later detail. quickly over definitions these loop control statements. Sr.No. Name control statement Description Break statement This command terminates loop's execution transfers program's control statement next loop. Continue statement This command skips current iteration loop. statements following continue statement executed once Python interpreter reaches continue statement. Pass statement pass statement used when statement syntactically necessary, code executed. Loop Python's loop designed repeatedly execute code block while iterating through list, tuple, dictionary, other iterable objects Python. process traversing sequence known iteration. Syntax Loop value sequence: code block this case, variable value used hold value every item present sequence before iteration begins until this particular iteration completed. Loop iterates until final item sequence reached. Code Python program show loop works Creating sequence which tuple numbers numbers variable store square number square Creating empty list squares Creating loop value numbers: square value squares.append(square) print("The list squares is", squares) Output: list squares [16, 100, Using else Statement with Loop already said, loop executes code block until sequence element reached. statement written right after loop executed after execution loop complete. Only execution complete does else statement comes into play. won't executed exit loop error thrown. Here code better understand if-else statements. Code Python program show if-else statements work string "Python Loop" Initiating loop string: giving condition block "o": print("If block") condition satisfied then else block will executed else: print(s) Output: block block block similarly, using else with loop. Syntax: value sequence: executes statements until sequences exhausted else: executes these statements when loop completed Code Python program show else statement with loop Creating sequence tuple_ Initiating loop value tuple_: value print(value) giving else statement else: print("These numbers present tuple") Output: These numbers present tuple range() Function With help range() function, produce series numbers. range(10) will produce values between (10 numbers). give specific start, stop, step size values manner range(start, stop, step size). step size specified, defaults Since doesn't create every value "contains" after construct range object characterized being "slow." does provide len, __getitem__ actions, iterator. example that follows will make this clear. Code Python program show working range() function print(range(15)) print(list(range(15))) print(list(range(4, 9))) print(list(range(5, 4))) Output: range(0, iterate through sequence items, apply range() method loops. indexing iterate through given sequence combining with iterable's len() function. Here's illustration. Code Python program iterate over sequence with help indexing tuple_ ("Python", "Loops", "Sequence", "Condition", "Range") iterating over tuple_ using range() function iterator range(len(tuple_)): print(tuple_[iterator].upper()) Output: PYTHON LOOPS SEQUENCE CONDITION RANGE While Loop While loops used Python iterate until specified condition met. However, statement program that follows while loop executed once condition changes false. Syntax while loop while <condition>: code block coding statements that follow structural command define code block. These statements intended with same number spaces. Python groups statements together with indentation. Code Python program show while loop counter Initiating loop while counter giving condition counter counter print("Python Loops") Output: Python Loops Python Loops Python Loops Python Loops Using else Statement with while Loops discussed earlier loop section, else statement with while loop also. same syntax. Code #Python program show else statement with while loop counter Iterating through while loop while (counter 10): counter counter print("Python Loops") Executed untile condition Once condition while loop gives False this statement will executed else: print("Code block inside else statement") Output: Python Loops Python Loops Python Loops Python Loops Code block inside else statement Single statement while Block loop declared single statement, seen below. This similar if-else block, where write code block single line. Code Python program show write single statement while loop counter while (count print("Python Loops") Loop Control Statements will discuss loop control statements detail. will example each control statement. Continue Statement returns control beginning loop. Code Python program show continue statement works Initiating loop string "Python Loops": string string string "t": continue print('Current Letter:', string) Output: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Break Statement stops execution loop when break statement reached. Code Python program show break statement works Initiating loop string "Python Loops": string 'L': break print('Current Letter: string) Output: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Current Letter: Pass Statement Pass statements used create empty loops. Pass statement also employed classes, functions, empty control statements. Code Python program show pass statement works string "Python Loops": pass print( 'Last Letter:', string) Output: Last Letter: Next TopicPython Loop prev next
