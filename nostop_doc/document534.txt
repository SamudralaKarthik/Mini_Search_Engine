next prev Difference between Materialized View View Views most important concept database management system. interview, popular commonly asked question, much like truncate delete, correlated, correlated noncorrelated subquery, primary unique key. This tutorial will learn about difference between view materialized view. original table stored physical memory database. which access attributes running queries. sometimes, have restrict user fetch some data from table allow them only permitted attributes. Suppose have student table, user search student names, marks, branches, ages, other information about student. user must allowed fetch student's mobile numbers addresses. such cases, good create view that show data required attributes table. achieve such functionality creating virtual table view Materialized view. Let's understand concepts views. What View? Views virtual table database that acts actual relation. part logical relational model database system. They created using select query, result stored physical memory. Every time fire query view, view returns updated latest data from original table. means views generated every time view accessed. this view, query definition stored database itself. create many views want. point remember that when make change virtual table, will reflect original table. make changes original base table, changes will reflected view. This makes query performance very slow. example create view from join more tables. this case, have resolve joins create them every time fetch data. However, provides some advantages, such doesn't require memory store data. create view using below syntax. Syntax Create view <select query expression> Note Views that created using DISTINCT clause, Group clause, check constraint, read only option can't modified. Advantages View following some important advantages views. Views simply base table that consists huge amount data. define virtual table data requirements. Views easily define joining more tables. Views hide complexity data. Views limit degree exposure underlying tables outer world. What Materialized View? Materialized views also known virtual tables, result query expression saved physical memory. query definition also stored database. also consider them Physical copy original base tables. primarily used context warehousing data. There standard view define materialized view SQL. However, database management systems offer custom extensions materialized views. Unlike normal view, they updated each time they used. Instead, need update manually with help trigger. process updating Materialized view known Materialized View Maintenance. stores result physical memory, responds faster than normal view because normal view created whenever query. mainly used summarizing, pre-computing, replicating distributing data, etc. Let's understand syntax materialized view. Create Materialized View view_name Build [clause] Refresh type] [trigger <query expression> above syntax, Build clause decides when populate materialized view. contains options IMMEDIATE populate materialized view immediately. DEFFERED Need refresh materialized view manually least once. Refresh type define update materialized view. There three options FAST materialized view logs required against source table advance, without logs, creation fails. fast refresh attempted. fast refresh attempted. COMPLETE table segment supporting materialized view truncated repopulated completely using associated query. FORCE materialized logs required. fast refresh attempted. trigger defines when update materialized view. refresh triggered ways COMMIT When data change committed dependent tables. refresh triggered. DEMAND refresh happens when schedule task manual request. have discussed basic concept normal view materialized view. Now, let's difference between normal view materialized view. Advantages Materialized View following some important advantages materialized view. Materialized view optimizes query performance, using same sub-query results every time. data updated frequent materialized view, user needs update data manually using trigger clause. reduces chances error returns efficient outcome. Materialized views transparent automatically maintained with help snowflake, which background services. Difference between View Materialized View following important difference between view materialized view. View Materialized View Views virtual projection base table. query expressions stored database resulting data query expression. resulting data query expression both saved physical memory (database system). Views generally created joining more tables. Materialized views primary used warehousing data. view virtual table that based select query also known snapshot view data which provides access duplicate, physical data separate table. commands cannot used they created using multiple tables. commands used materialized view matter they created. There updation cost involve normal view. does have updation cost associated with Views respond slowly. causes query performances. Materialized view responds faster. Because store data database. Views defined according fixed design architecture approach which based standard defining view. There predefined standard defining database provides functionality form extension. Views more effective when data accessed infrequently data table updated frequent basis. Materialized views mostly used when data accessed more frequently data updated frequently. Conclusion Views played crucial role data retrieval. this tutorial, have covered definition views materialized view important advantages. have defined both views with suitable example. Here understand primary difference between both views choose according your requirements. Next TopicNamespace Python prev next
