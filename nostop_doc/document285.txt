next prev Name Mangling Python this tutorial, going discuss name mangling process Python name mangling process Python with different methods. Name Mangling process which given identifier with trailing underscore leading underscores textually replaced with __ClassName__Identifier known Name mangling. __ClassName__Identifier name, ClassName name current class where identifier present. Illustration: Basically, above given definition name mangling means that identifier form such __Jtp (Either least leading underscores most underscore trailing name) will replaced __ClassName__Jtp (the name current class will replace ClassName) with leading underscore (s) striped ClassName. Look following example understand name mangling process. Example: testing class identifier class Testing: Giving Name identifier __init__(self, name): Identifier initializing self.__name name PrintName(self): print(self.__name) Testing("JavaTpoint") Calling variable name with class t1.PrintName() Printing name output Output: JavaTpoint Explanation: have defined testing class with name identifier class above program. Inside testing class, have defined default functions with PrintName(). PrintName() function, have given print command print name. Then, initialized variable with testing class. last, have used PrintName() print name used Testing class while initializing Note: access functions variables Testing class outside class, will throw error. changes made variable given inside Testing Class done inside class only. Example: testing class identifier class Testing: Giving Name identifier __init__(self, name): Identifier initializing with double underscore self.__name name PrintName(self): print(self.__name) Testing("JavaTpoint") Calling variable name with class t1.PrintName() Printing name output Accessing identifier outside class print(t1.__name) will throw error output Output: JavaTpoint Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Users\Manish\Downloads\code.py", line print(t1.__name) will throw error output AttributeError: 'Testing' object attribute '__name' Name Mangling Python Implementation name mangling process Python same have discussed above. will different methods Python program implement name mangling process accessing variables will perform following tasks this section: Name mangling Python with dir() method Accessing Name mangled variables program Name mangling with method overriding Python will program each method understand implementation Python. Name mangling with dir() method dir() method perform name mangling process, will done class given code. Python interpreter will process name mangling class. dir() method passing defined class object dir() method will return valid attributes belonging given class object. Look following exemplar program understand this dir() method name mangling: Example: testing class name mangling class Testing: __init__(self, name): self.__name name Initializing variable with testing class Testing("JavaTpoint") Using dir() method initialized variable print(dir(t1)) Output: ['_Testing__name', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__'] Explanation: look output, that dir() method used initialized variable, i.e., returned valid attributes class testing printed them. also that name identifier, i.e., __name, changed _Testing__name interpreter. Accessing name mangled variables access name mangled variables even outside class print output (Not like accessing class variable that will return error). access name mangled variables outside class, simply have _ClassName with variable, also print value output. Look following program where have accessed name mangled variables outside testing class. Example: testing class name mangling class Testing: __init__(self, name): self.__name name Initializing variable with testing class Testing("JavaTpoint") Accessing Name mangled variables outside testing class print("The name mangled that accessing outside class: t1._Testing__name) Output: name mangled that accessing outside class: JavaTpoint Explanation: have been able access __name variable outside name mangled variable, returned name value output. Name mangling using method overriding using name mangling process program, limited because little support valid case members from private class. limited support private class member's valid case avoid name clashes various names with names defined inside subclasses. long name mangling process will occur definition Python class, mangling process will done interpreter. And, very helpful subclasses program them override methods without even breaking calls interclass method. Let's understand following example. Example: default testing class name mangling class Testing: __init__(self): self.__jtp() name mangling with Jtp variable jtp(self): default function name mangling parent class print("Name mangling process done inside parent testing class") copy jtp() method private class members __jtp Name mangling with method overriding process subclass Testing class class SubTesting(Testing): Providing signature jtp() function jtp(self): print("Name mangling process done inside child sub-testing class") Calling objects from subclass function SubTesting() obj.jtp() Output: Name mangling process done inside parent testing class Name mangling process done inside child sub-testing class Conclusion First, have learned about introduction Name mangling process this tutorial. also learned that dir() method name mangling Python. Then, accessed name mangled variables outside class which they present. last, also learn about that name mangling process with method overriding given subclasses program.
