next prev Broken Pipe Error Python Nowadays, Python considered mature programming language that been used popularly data scientists Artificial Intelligence (AI) engineers because simplicity easy-to-read syntax. Apart from this, vague errors programming language generally make programmers pull their hair debug. following tutorial, will discuss [Errno Broken pipe, famous error message have often seen while interacting with file system. will also understand cause this, along with methods avoid code. What causes "[Errno Broken pipe" Python? "Broken pipe" usually considered IOError (short Input/Output Error) error, which occurred Linux system level. generally raised while reading writing files, other terms, performing file input/output network input/output (through sockets). equivalent Linux system error EPIPE, excerpted from libc error codes. Macro: EPIPE "Broken pipe." there process reading from other pipe. Every function library raising error code also produces SIGPIPE signal; this signal terminates program handled blocked. Hence, program will never actually display EPIPE until handled blocked SIGPIPE. From above statement, conclude that system sending SIGPIPE signal causes [Errno Broken pipe error, inter-process communication mechanism Linux. instance, Linux system uses another signal called SIGINT internally. Linux, command Ctrl+C will send SIGINT signal order process, utilize kill command order achieve same effect. Python does disregard SIGPIPE default. However, translates signal into exception raises error IOError: [Errno Broken pipe every time receives SIGPIPE. Broken Pipe error when piping results Linux terminal Whenever encounter [Errno Broken pipe error while attempting pipe output Python script another program, such shown following example: Example: python file_name.py head Explanation: above syntax pipeline will create process sending data upstream process reading data downstream. When downstream does have read upstream data, will send SIGPIPE signal process upstream. When does downstream have read upstream data? understand this with example. head command example only read enough lines order tell upstream that longer have read will send SIGPIPE signal process upstream. Whenever upstream process Python program, error like IOError: [Errno Broken pipe will happen. avoid Broken pipe errors? care about properly catching SIGPIPE have things running rapidly, insert following snippet code Python program. Syntax: from signal import signal, SIGPIPE, SIG_DFL #Ignore SIG_PIPE don't throw exceptions it... (http://docs.python.org/library/signal.html) signal(SIGPIPE,SIG_DFL) Explanation: above snippet code, have redirected SIGPIPE signals default SIG_DFL, which system generally ignore. However, advised beware Python manual signal library warn against this handling SIGPIPE. Properly catching IOError avoid Broken pipe error Broken pipe error IOError error, place try/catch block order catch shown following snippet code: Syntax: import sys, errno try: operation except IOError e.errno errno.EPIPE: Handle error Explanation: above snippet code, have imported errno module placed try/catch block order catch raised exception handle possible solution Broken pipe error multi-process program programs that utilize worker processes speed processing make utilization multi-core CPUs, attempt reduce count worker processes check whether error remains not. large number worker processes conflict with each other while trying take control resources system permission order write into disk.
