next prev Python program find Fibonacci Number following tutorial, will understand find Fibonacci Number using Python. define Fibonacci Number, where following number preceding numbers. first elements Fibonacci series respectively. calculate third element series adding preceding elements will third term which equal Similarly, fourth term will second third terms, which series such numbers known Fibonacci Series. recurrence relation defines Fibonacci number shown below: There different ways find Fibonacci Number using Python programming language. Some them follows: Finding Fibonacci Number using Recursion Finding Fibonacci Number using dynamic programming Finding Fibonacci Number using dynamic programming space optimization Finding Fibonacci Number using arrays these ways, most fundamental Recursion method Dynamic method. understand working these methods detail with examples. Finding Fibonacci Number using Recursion term recursion used define something within itself. programming language like Python, Recursion refers process function calling itself. With proper correct code, Recursion will create finite loop. consider following snippet code better understanding. Example: defining function Fibonacci Series Fibonacci_Series(n): using if-else conditional statement print("Oops! Incorrect input") First Fibonacci number elif return Second Fibonacci number elif return else: return (Fibonacci_Series(n Fibonacci_Series(n printing 12th element Fibonacci Series print("12th Element Fibonacci Series:", Fibonacci_Series(12)) Output: 12th Element Fibonacci Series: Explanation: above snippet code, have defined function Fibonacci_Series() that accepts parameter Moreover, aware that first elements Fibonacci event input (First Second terms Fibonacci series), have used if-else conditional statement return case value greater than function will call itself with lower input value. observe that code returns (Fibonacci_Series(n Fibonacci_Series(n 2)). Here, function calls itself with lower value unless reaches base value know from before, returns returns returned values then continuously added produce sequence Fibonacci Series. Finding Fibonacci Number using Dynamic Programming Dynamic Programming utilizes Recursion well; however, mainly utilizes if-else conditional statements. Within statements, value Fibonacci number stored variable. With help Recursion, repeated addition allows obtain this Fibonacci number. consider following example understand same. Example: defining function find Fibonacci Number Fibonacci_series(x): Taking First terms Fibonacci Series fib_Array Here, know that first terms Fibonacci Series append remaining values (Fibonacci numbers from index array using recursion return last element. range function, take range(2, instead range(2, This because range function python iterates until value before upper limit. take from would only iterate from second 1)th element. range(2, fib_Array.append(fib_Array[n fib_Array[n return fib_Array[x] print("12th Term Fibonacci Series:", Fibonacci_series(12)) Output: 12th Term Fibonacci Series: Explanation: above snippet code, defined function Fibonacci_series(), which accepts parameter variable created one-dimensional array fib_Array with data elements zeroth first indices. Then, provided input ('x') less than equal which also length array fib_Array, returns first number second number value greater than have used recursion call insert preceding data elements. However, rather than returning Fibonacci number directly, append each summated elements fib_Array array. last, have returned last element array (i.e., element) printed value users. Finding Fibonacci Number using Dynamic Programming Space Optimization This method almost completely identical Dynamic Programming. However, dynamic programming utilizes recursion accomplish recurring addition, whereas this method utilizes for-loop. consider following example understand same. Example: defing function return element Fibonacci Series Fibonacci_series(x): assiging variables using if-elif-else conditional statements print("Wrong input") elif return elif return else: using for-loop range(2, return printing twelveth term Fibonacci Series print("12th element Fibonacci Series:", Fibonacci_series(12)) Output: 12th element Fibonacci Series: Explanation: above snippet code, have defined function assigned variables, These elements first second elements Fibonacci Series. have then used if-elif-else conditional statements where program returns input value input value value greater than have used for-loop range have taken variable store preceding elements series. Once takes value value reassigned Subsequently, value reassigned value o. This process continues, value keeps reassigning until loop terminates. Once loop terminated, function returns value which stores value Fibonacci Number. Finding Fibonacci Number using Array this method, create array size repeated addition using for-loop. Hence, Fibonacci Number returned. consider following example understand same. Example: defining function Fibonacci_series(x): creating array function fib_Array fib_Array[1] adding elements series array using addition previous elements. range fib_Array[n] fib_Array[n fib_Array[n return fib_Array[x] __name__ "__main__": print("12th element Fibonacci series:", Fibonacci_series(12)) Output: 12th element Fibonacci series: Explanation: above snippet code, have defined function. Within function, have created array find element Fibonacci Series. have then used for-loop elements series array repeating addition preceding elements. last, element returned printed users.
