next prev Ethical Hacking with Python computer science engineer, part encrypting world, must know basics hacking. Hacking process getting access system which supposed have. Such login email account without authorization part hacking that account. Getting access computer mobile phone without authorization hacking. There large number ways user hack into system, basic concept hacking same, breaking into system without authentication. Ethical Hacking Ethical hacking limited cracking passwords stealing data. Ethical hacking used scanning vulnerabilities finding potential threats computer system networks. Ethical hackers find weak points loopholes system, applications, networks report them organization. There different types hackers, following some: Black Hackers Black Hackers people entered inside website unethically stealing data from admin portal manipulate data. They basically this their profit take advantage personal data. Their main purpose cause major damage company, this even lead dangerous consequences. White Hacker They type hackers work finding bugs report them ethically organizations firms. They authorized user testing checking bugs networks websites report back developers authorized people. white-hat hacker usually gets required information about website network system they testing from firm itself. They hacked system with authorization. They this they save website from malicious hackers future. Grey Hackers These types hackers access data website network violate cyber law. they don't have same intentions Black Hackers They hack system common good, they different from white hackers, they exploit vulnerability publicly, white hackers privately firm organization. user should user Python programming hacking? Python language used widely general purposes, it's high-level programming language. very simple powerful scripting language that open source object-oriented. Python inbuilt libraries which used various functions, hacking them. Python very popular, great demand market. Learning hack using Python will great understanding language better. Passwords Hacked? know that passwords websites files stored form plain text database websites. this tutorial, going hack plain text, which secured password. plain text, passwords stored hashed (md5) format. user take input_hashed(which hashed password stored database), then they have compare with hashed(md5) each plain text password which found password file. When match hashed password found, user display plain text password, which stored file passwords. password found file input passwords, then will display that "Password found", this happens only when buffer overflow does occur. These types hacking attacks considered "Dictionary Attacks". Example: import hashlib print("# Password Hacking check password found text file. password_found input_hashed input(" Please enter hashed password: password_document input(" Please enter passwords file name including path (root home/): try: here, will open passwords text file. password_file open(password_document, 'r') except: print("Error: print(password_document, found.\n Please enter path file correctly.") quit() now, comparing input_hashed with hashes words present password text file finding password. word password_file: encode word into utf-8 format encoding_word word.encode('utf-8') Hash word into hash hashed_word hashlib.md5(encoding_word.strip()) digest that hash into hexadecimal value digesting hashed_word.hexdigest() digesting input_hashed: compare hashes print ("Password found.\n required password word) password_found break password found text file. password_found: print(" password found password_document, "file") print('\n') print(" Thank Input Password Hacking Please enter hashed password: 1f23a6ea2da3425697d6446cf3402124 Please enter passwords file name including path (root home/): passwords.txt Output: Password found. required password manchester123 Thank Input Password Hacking Please enter hashed password: b24aefc835df9ff09ef4dddc4f817737 Please enter passwords file name including path (root home/): passwords.txt Output: Password found. required password heartbreaker07 Thank Input Password Hacking Please enter hashed password: 33816712db4f3913ee967469fe7ee982 Please enter passwords file name including path (root home/): passwords.txt Output: password found passwords.txt file. Explanation: above code, first imported "hashlib" module contains various methods which handle hashing message encrypted method. Then user input hashed password location passwords text file. Then, user trying open text file, text file found mentioned location, will print error "File found". Then, compare input hashed password with hashed words present text file find correct password; that, have encode words into utf-8 format then hash words into hash. Then digest hashed word into hexadecimal values. digested value equal input hash password, will print password found print correct password value. password found, that means digested value does match with input hash password. will print "Password found". Conclusion this tutorial, have discussed ethical hacking Python, have also shown example hack password. Next TopicClass Variable Instance prev next
