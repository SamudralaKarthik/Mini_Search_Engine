next prev Python Module computer science engineering terms, language understandable computers totally different from language daily life, like English, Chinese, French, Hindi, many others. Then, question comes does computer understand presents output language which give input commands. While seems very complex process, actually, that complex understand learn. input command which providing computer other electronic devices language converted into computer-readable form (machine language), then, computer performs operations according converted command machine language. After that, result also yielded computer machine language, finally, this result again converted human-readable form presented output operation. Along with operations, which expect computers perform according given input command, this conversion commands into machine language again into human-readable form happens same time. There many other processes where conversion commands required executing process. This conversion commands also explained compression decompression commands files. When transfer data from device another, compressed into computer-readable form, then again, decompressed into human-readable form. this process compression decompression quite similar conversion process commands files, that's these terms also used interchangeably. daily life, there many instances when performing this compression decompression files texts unknowingly. example, when send messages texts someone, first compressed, after being received recipient, this message again decompressed, that's communication happens between devices. world programming development, many programming languages provide option performing operation compression decompression texts files. Talking about Python only, also multiple libraries which compress decompress given text file. functions these libraries packages Python program compress decompress given text file. module Python such module that Python programs compress decompress given text file. Therefore, will learn about this module Python this tutorial learn perform compression decompression operations given texts files using functions this module. Introduction Module Python module Python specifically designed perform operations decompression compression given texts files program. those Python modules which carry compression decompression operations given texts files very smoothly. module Python based bzip2 compression algorithm, algorithm specifically designed perform operations compression decompression texts files. either directly provide texts text file into program performing compression decompression operations, according this bzip2 compression algorithm. Since, Python, don't have char data type; therefore, module designed performing compression decompression operations input strings text files opened program. This module comes with lots functions that used perform multiple operations related compression decompression strings text files. will learn about these functions module later parts this tutorial understand their implementation using them example Python programs. before using these functions example programs, will learn their working them. Module Python: Installation module in-built module, which means this module comes pre-installed with installation Python. Therefore, using latest versions Python, don't need perform kind installation process installing this module, directly start working with this module. even verify that this module present system when start working with functions this module execute them. only have following import statement functions module given Python program: Importing in-built compression module import Therefore, directly proceed with implementation part this module understand implementation functions this module. Module Python: Important Functions Before move ahead with implementation part this module, will learn some important functions this module. These functions important learn because using these functions; will able perform compression decompression opening, closing, saving compressed decompressed text file Python program. Following some important functions module with their brief explanation: open(): open function module used opening text file (compressed text file well), Python program that further compression operations performed Following syntax using open() function this module: bz2.open(nameOfFile, mode 'rb', compresslevel encoding None, errors None, newline None) syntax given above, open() function module takes multiple arguments, these arguments compulsory arguments. Apart from name file, other arguments either optional should used while opening compressed text file. Following description arguments provided this open() function: nameOfFile: name file present same directory program) that want open program, file present same directory, have provide complete directory path file. (ii) mode: mode used define mode file that opening program, different normal text files compressed text files. text mode, 'at', 'xt', 'wt', 'rt' whereas, binary mode, 'ab', 'a', 'xb', 'x', 'wb', 'w', 'rb', mode options available. These different mode options used defining different types operations that perform opened file. don't define mode argument with filename function, will 'rb' default argument. (iii) compresslevel: This argument optional argument only used cases when opening compressed file using open() function. have define compress level compressed file integer form, ranging from according compression level file. (iv) encoding: have provide that there kind encoding format used file opening. don't have provide this argument open() function compulsorily. errors: This also optional argument open() function, which used define errors present file not. (vi) newline: This optional argument open() function which used define there newlines present opened file. This description arguments that provided open() function. BZ2File(): BZ2File() function module works similar open() function, only used opening compressed files binary format. Following syntax using BZ2File() function module opening compressed format file: bz2.BZ2File(nameOfFile, mode 'w', compresslevel see, arguments provided this function same arguments have provide inside open() function. BZ2FILE() function takes only three optional arguments. BZ2Compressor(): BZ2Compressor() function module used create compression object program, which compressing opened file program. Following syntax using BZ2Compressor() function module creating compression object: BZ2Compressor(compresslevel see, this function takes only compresslevel argument inside this argument mandatory argument function. have provide compresslevel, according which opened files will compressed program. peek(): peek function module used returning buffered data from text file that have opened program. This commonly used function module, have this peek() function when performing high-level compression decompression files. compress(): compress() function module used compressing string text file provided input source program. provide file name, input string given, variable that defined holding this data argument function. Following syntax using compress() function program compressing strings text files: bz2.compress('File String') see, this compress() function takes only argument compress file string, which provided input argument. flush(): have this function when compressing file using compress() function with compression object. flush() function module used saving closing compressing process after text file compressed successfully. When using this function, don't have exit compression object after this function program. This function returns compressed data file returned internal buffers server. decompress(): decompress() function module used decompressing compressed string text file provided input source program. provide compressed file name, input string given, variable name defined holding this data argument function. Following syntax using decompress() function program decompressing compressed strings text files: bz2.decompress('File String') see, this function takes only argument, decompress compressed files strings, provided input argument. This complete description important functions module, which Python program compressing decompressing text file input string. With help these functions, carry compression decompression operations input string text file very easily. Module Python: Implementation have learned basic details important functions module, only through which understand they will work using them inside Python program. When these functions example programs, will better understand learn these functions actually working input text files strings. this tutorial, will only work with input strings provided user given program, therefore, will compress decompress function module this part. working other functions also very similar, understand these functions work, will very easy work with other functions this module. this part, will look some examples which either take user input string compress provide input compressed string decompress Look following example programs understand working compress() decompress() function module: Example Compressing input string provided program: this example program, will provide input string program then compress Look following Python program where have given input string program compressed program using compress() function: Importing in-built module import Providing string input program inStr b'This string provided user JavaTpoint compress!'
