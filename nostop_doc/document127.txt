next prev Python Scala this tutorial, will learn basic difference between Python Scala. Both languages have some similarities here will main difference between them. Let's start with their introduction. What Python? Python high-level, general purpose, user-friendly dynamic programming language. easy learn take fewer lines execute code. Python provides many in-built libraries, modules many other features. most popular programming languages. Programmers prefer this language because simplicity, vast number libraries, built-in modules. very attractive language Rapid Application Development. Python used almost every domains such development, machine learning, artificial intelligence many more. object-oriented programming. What Scala? Scala stands "scalable language, general purpose, high-level programming language. combines functional programming object-oriented programming. works upon (Java Virtual Machine) includes with prevailing Java Code libraries. comparison other languages, scala code error-free, short readable. simple writing, compiling, running programs debugging. scala source code developed unique manner that compiler interpret Java classes. static types helps programmer avoid complex program. JavaScript allow build high-performance systems that easily accessible huge ecosystem libraries. Difference between Python Scala Let's understand following major difference between Python Scala. Python Scala Python object oriented, dynamic type programming language. Scala object oriented, static type programming language. Python easy learn. Scala easier learn than Python. doesn't need specify data type while declaring variables because dynamic type programming language. Scala, need define type variable object because Scala statically type programming language. Python slow because runs interpreter creates extra work There extra work created because thus runs much faster than Python. Python decides data type runtime. Scala doesn't this case that's more preferred language large data process than Python. Python huge community across world. Scala also large community Python. Python most recommended language beginners because easy write code Python. Scala easy learn than Python difficult write code Python. Python provides wide range libraries modules there interface Python many system call libraries. Scala compiled language that's source code compiled before execution. There much chance create when make change existing Python code then There such type problem. Python doesn't support proper multithreading, through supports heavyweight process forking. Scala list asynchronous libraries reactive cores hence better choice implementing concurrently. Python consists proper data science tools machine learning Natural language processing (NLP). Scala contains various existential types, macros, implicit. syntax with advance features little hard compared usual functions however allow developers make good these features. Python extensive developer pool. Scala limited developer pool. Python suitable concurrent programming. Scala quite suitable concurrent programming. Python used small scale project. Scala used large-scale projects. There scalable features. provides scalable features support. have listed above important difference between Python Scala. Both languages quite different each other Python more popular highly developed programming language. other hand, Scala doesn't have widespread knowledge base. Conclusion selection programming language entirely depends upon features that best project need both languages have pros cons. totally depends project requirements, time efficiency many other different discussed aspects. select language achieve goal. Developer should analyze must familiar with merits demerits programming languages. Next TopicQueue Python prev next
