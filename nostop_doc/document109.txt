next prev What object Python Python object-oriented programming language. Everything Python treated object, including variable, function, list, tuple, dictionary, set, etc. Every object belongs class. example integer variable belongs integer class. object real-life entity. object collection various data functions that operate those data. object contains following properties. State attributes object represents state. also reflects properties object. Behavior method object represents behavior. Identity Each object must uniquely identified allow interacting with other objects. Let's understand object aspect classes. classes objects essential object-oriented programming. Classes blueprint object. Classes used bundling data functionality together. Each newly created class must have object. Let's understand real-life example class object. human class which have attributes such walking, sleeping, thinking, etc. Suppose want name humans, don't need create class every person. just need instantiate multiple objects that perticular class. class contains user-defined data structure that holds data members such variables, constructs, member functions, which accessed creating object class. syntax creating class given below. syntax creating class given below. Syntax: class ClassName: #statement_suite class keyword used define class user-define class name replaces ClassName. Creating Object class object essential work with class attributes. Instantiate term used when create object class, instance also referred object. object created using class name. syntax given below. Syntax: <object-name> <class-name>(<arguments>) following example, have created object Person class. Example class Person: name "John" display (self): print("Age: \nName: %s"%(self.age,self.name)) Creating instance Employee class Person() per.display() Output: Age: Name: John Explanation: above code, have created Person class which consisted attributes age, name display function. created object person class called Using object along with .dot operator, accessed class function.
