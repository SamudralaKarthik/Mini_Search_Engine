next prev First Python Program this Section, will discuss basic syntax Python, will simple program print Hello World console. Python provides ways program: Using Interactive interpreter prompt Using script file Let's discuss each them detail. Interactive interpreter prompt Python provides feature execute Python statement interactive prompt. preferable case where concerned about output each line Python program. open interactive mode, open terminal command prompt) type python (python3 case have Python2 Python3 both installed your system). will open following prompt where execute Python statement check their impact console. After writing print statement, press Enter key. Here, message "Hello World printed console. Using script file (Script Mode Programming) interpreter prompt best single-line statements code. However, cannot write code every-time terminal. suitable write multiple lines code. Using script mode, write multiple lines code into file which executed later. this purpose, need open editor like notepad, create file named save with extension, which stands "Python". Now, will implement above example using script mode. print ("hello world"); #here, have used print() function print message console. this file named first.py, need following command terminal. Step Open Python interactive shell, click "File" then choose "New", will open blank script which write code. Step Now, write code press "Ctrl+S" save file. Step After saving code, clicking "Run" "Run Module". will display output shell. output will shown follows. Step Apart from that, also file using operating system terminal. But, should aware path directory where have saved file. Open command line prompt navigate directory. need type python keyword, followed file name enter Python file. Multi-line Statements Multi-line statements written into notepad like editor saved with extension. following example, have defined execution multiple code lines using Python script. Code: name "Andrew Venis" branch "Computer Science" "25" print("My name name, print("My age) Script File: Pros Cons Script Mode script mode advantages disadvantages well. Let's understand following advantages running code script mode. multiple lines code. Debugging easy script mode. appropriate beginners also experts. Let's disadvantages script mode. have save code every time make change code. tedious when single lines code. Started with PyCharm first program, have used gedit CentOS editor. Windows, have alternative like notepad notepad++ edit code. However, these editors used python since they unable show syntax related suggestions. JetBrains provides most popular widely used cross-platform PyCharm python programs. PyCharm installation have already stated, PyCharm cross-platform IDE, hence installed variety operating systems. this section tutorial, will cover installation process PyCharm Windows, MacOS, CentOS, Ubuntu. Windows Installing PyCharm Windows very simple. install PyCharm Windows operating system, visit link https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows download executable installer. Double click installer (.exe) file install PyCharm clicking next each step. create first program Pycharm follows following step. Step Open Pycharm editor. Click "Create Project" option create project. Step Select location save project. save newly created project desired memory location keep file location atleast change project default name untitled "FirstProject" something meaningful. Pycharm automatically found installed Python interpreter. After change name click "Create" Button. Step Click "File" menu select "New". clicking "New" option will show various file formats. Select "Python File". Step type name Python file click "OK". have written "FirstProgram". Step type first program print("Hello World") then click "Run" menu program. Step output will appear bottom screen. Basic Syntax Python Indentation Comment Python Indentation most significant concept Python programming language. Improper indentation will "IndentationError" code. Indentation nothing adding whitespaces before statement when needed. Without indentation Python doesn't know which statement executed next. Indentation also defines which statements belong which block. there indentation improper indentation, will display "IndentationError" interrupt code. Python indentation defines particular group statements belongs particular block. programming languages such C++, java curly braces define code blocks. Python, statements that same level right belong same block. four whitespaces define indentation. Let's following lines code. Example list1 list1: print(i) i==4: break print("End loop") Output: loop Explanation: above code, loop code blocks statement code block inside loop. Both indented with four whitespaces. last print() statement indented; that's means doesn't belong loop. Comments Python Comments essential defining code help other understand code. looking comment, easily understand intention every line that have written code. also find error very easily, them, other applications. Python, apply comments using hash character. Python interpreter entirely ignores lines followed hash character. good programmer always uses comments make code under stable. Let's following example comment. name "Thomas" Assigning string value name variable comment each line Python code. Fees 10000 defining course fees 10000 Fees 20000 defining course fees 20000 good idea code line code section code whose purpose obvious. This best practice learn while doing coding. Types Comment Python provides facility write comments ways- single line comment multi-line comment. Single-Line Comment Single-Line comment starts with hash character followed text further explanation. defining marks student Marks also write comment next code statement. Consider following example. Name "James" name student James Marks defining student's marks Branch "Computer Science" defining student branch Multi-Line Comments Python doesn't have explicit support multi-line comments hash character multiple lines. example defining loop iterate given list. this code. also another way. This example multi-line comment Using triple-quotes This basic introduction comments. Visit Python Comment tutorial learn detail. Python Identifiers Python identifiers refer name used identify variable, function, module, class, module other objects. There rules follow while naming Python Variable. variable name must start with either English letter underscore (_). variable name cannot start with number. Special characters allowed variable name. variable's name case sensitive. Let's understand following example. Example number print(num) _a print(_a) x_y 1000 print(x_y) Output: 1000 have defined basic syntax Python programming language. must familiar with core concept programming languages. Once memorize concepts mentioned above. journey learning Python will become easier.
