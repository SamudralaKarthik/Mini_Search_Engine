next prev Python Faker Introduction Faker Python provides open-source library, also known Faker that helps user build their Dataset. generate random data using random attributes such Name, Age, Location, many more. Faker library supports central locations languages beneficial generate data relied locality. utilize this Faker data order tune models machine learning, stress test model, many more. generate data depending requirements. also Faker data training learning purposes, such perform various operations various types data types. also generated datasets purpose tuning model machine learning, validating model testing model. following tutorial, will understand Faker functions create very Dataset. begin with implementation Faker library. Implementation Faker Library Before start working faker, necessary install library. using installer command prompt terminal shown below: Syntax: install faker Importing necessary libraries order discover various functions faker library, must import faker library. also importing pandas library since will perform operations Dataset. Syntax: from faker import Faker import pandas Using various functions Once done importing required library, using various functions available Faker library. order perform such activity, have initiate Faker function with help variable shown below: Syntax: sample Faker() Some functions, going listed below: Syntax: sample.name() sample.date_of_birth() sample.address() sample.country() sample.email() consider example demonstrating working these functions: Example: importing required libraries from faker import Faker import pandas defining variable Faker() module sample Faker() using some functions print("Your Name: sample.name()) print("Your Date Birth: sample.date_of_birth()) print("Your Address: sample.address()) print("Your Country: sample.country()) print("Your E-mail Address: sample.email()) Output: Your Name: Teresa Hill Your Date Birth: 1950-03-12 Your Address: 430 Bauer Turnpike Suite 931 Annaton, 12319 Your Country: Angola Your E-mail Address: [email protected] Explanation: above example, have imported required libraries defined variable Faker() module. have then used some functions like name, date_of_birth, address, country, email generate some fake datasets. This generated dataset random that will different dataset output every time execute code. also generate information different localities regions different languages. have mention language want. consider following example where have generated some data languages like Hindi, French, Japanese. Example: importing required libraries from faker import Faker import pandas defining variable Faker() module sample Faker(['hi_IN', 'fr', 'jp_JP']) range(10): print(sample.name()) Output: Thomas Schneider ?????? ?????? Lucas Poulain ????? ?????? Aurélie Merle-Menard ????????, ?????? Stéphane Lefebvre-Alves ????? ????? Explanation: above example, have again defined required libraries defined variable Faker() module where have provided some languages parameters. have then used 'for' statement print different generated names specified number times. result, program generated different names different languages users. also generate texts sentences using functions like text sentences. consider following example understand these functions work. Example: importing required libraries from faker import Faker import pandas defining variable Faker() module sample Faker() printing text print("Text: sample.text()) printing sentence print("Sentence: sample.sentence()) Output: Text: Size plant task through score name. Whose learn drop ground. Option entire some surface seek film involve. Billion body really common decade man. Worker foreign your then likely beat. Sentence: Project star plant energy them leave. Explanation: above example, have again imported required modules defined variable Faker() module. have then used text sentence functions create sentences printed them users. result, have created sentences successfully. However, also define word library that stores list words that allows generate fake sentences using those specified words. consider following example generating fake sentences. Example: importing required libraries from faker import Faker import pandas defining variable Faker() module sample Faker() list words mywords ['Cow', 'domestic', 'why', 'what', 'bird', 'parrot', 'is', 'animal', 'a', 'my'] printing sentence print("Sentence: sample.sentence(ext_word_list mywords)) Output: Sentence: domestic domestic domestic animal animal. Explanation: above example, have again imported required libraries defined Faker() module variable. have defined list words used sentence() function create sentence using word library created. result, fake sentence been generated using words list. Moreover, Faker() module also provides function generate complete profiles different non-existing persons rather than generating names addresses separately. This function known profile function, generates fake profile person. consider following example understand behavior this function. Example: importing required libraries from faker import Faker import pandas defining variable Faker() module sample Faker() generating profile print("Complete Profile: sample.profile()) Output: Complete Profile: {'job': 'Minerals surveyor', 'company': 'Nichols Sons', 'ssn': '715-16-7081', 'residence': '550 Moore Locks\nSouth Andrea, 94842', 'current_location': (Decimal('-78.730969'), Decimal('-151.109875')), 'blood_group': 'B+', 'website': ['https://www.smith-avila.com/', 'http://bennett-scott.com/', 'https://www.nguyen.com/'], 'username': 'joseph04', 'name': 'Toni Martin', 'sex': 'F', 'address': '29676 Mann Rapid\nWilkinsonbury, MN 35916', 'mail': '[email protected]', 'birthdate': datetime.date(2016, 1)} Explanation: above example, have again imported required libraries defined variable. have then used profile function generate fake profile person printed users. Now, create fake dataset with help faker library. Creating Fake dataset using faker library Since have discovered most functions have already worked profile function previous section, generating dataset containing fake profiles unique people. order store these profiles into data frame, will using pandas library too. Example: importing required libraries from faker import Faker import pandas defining variable Faker() module sample Faker() generating profiles people mydata [sample.profile() range(20)] my_dframe pd.DataFrame(mydata) print(my_dframe) Output: company mail birthdate Housing manager/officer Cross LLC [email protected] 1983-03-26 Learning disability nurse Bennett-Sellers [email protected] 1923-04-14 Agricultural engineer Patrick PLC [email protected] 1941-01-13 Research scientist (life sciences) Coleman, Shaw Owens [email protected] 1927-07-07 Haematologist Jefferson-Bailey [email protected] 2001-06-06 Chartered legal executive (England Wales) Torres-Andersen [email protected] 1956-05-12 Statistician Rodriguez-Chung [email protected] 1955-07-06 Paediatric nurse Simmons, Acosta Gates [email protected] 1984-02-29 Dispensing optician Bauer [email protected] 1935-03-30 Equality diversity officer Martinez, Allen Davis [email protected] 2019-06-28 Secondary school teacher Greene, Gonzalez Hill [email protected] 1913-10-02 TEFL teacher Smith Sons [email protected] 1989-06-17 Planning development surveyor Smith, Reyes [email protected] 1905-09-05 Product designer Taylor, Davis Wilson [email protected] 1938-11-27 Development worker, community Carlson-Evans [email protected] 1929-03-08 Engineer, building services Pham Group [email protected] 1984-12-31 Therapist, horticultural Anderson-Gonzalez [email protected] 1929-03-16 Geographical information systems officer Burke-Burton [email protected] 1997-06-12 Retail manager Rivera-Lucas [email protected] 2016-03-20 Therapeutic radiographer Holloway Group [email protected] 2011-02-23 rows columns] Explanation: above example, have again imported required libraries defined variable. have then defined data that contains profiles people. last, have converted this data into data frames printed users. result, generated dataset stores various attributes such job, company, locations, email, more. utilize this dataset requirements.
