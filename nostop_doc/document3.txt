next prev Python Applications Python known general-purpose nature that makes applicable almost every domain software development. Python makes presence every emerging field. fastest-growing programming language develop application. Here, specifying application areas where Python applied. Applications Python develop applications. provides libraries handle internet protocols such HTML XML, JSON, Email processing, request, beautifulSoup, Feedparser, etc. Python web-framework named Django used Instagram. Python provides many useful frameworks, these given below: Django Pyramid framework(Use heavy applications) Flask Bottle (Micro-framework) Plone Django (Advance Content management) Desktop Applications stands Graphical User Interface, which provides smooth interaction application. Python provides library develop user interface. Some popular libraries given below. Tkinter wxWidgetM Kivy (used writing multitouch applications PyQt Pyside Console-based Application Console-based applications from command-line shell. These applications computer program which used commands execute. This kind application more popular generation computers. Python develop this kind application very effectively. famous having REPL, which means Read-Eval-Print Loop that makes most suitable language command-line applications. Python provides many free library module which helps build command-line apps. necessary libraries used read write. helps parse argument create console help text out-of-the-box. There also advance libraries that develop independent console apps. Software Development Python useful software development process. works support language used build control management, testing, etc. SCons used build control. Buildbot Apache Gumps used automated continuous compilation testing. Round Trac tracking project management. Scientific Numeric This Artificial intelligence where machine perform task same human. Python language most suitable language Artificial intelligence machine learning. consists many scientific mathematical libraries, which makes easy solve complex calculations. Implementing machine learning algorithms require complex mathematical calculation. Python many libraries scientific numeric such Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc. have some basic knowledge Python, need import libraries code. popular frameworks machine libraries given below. SciPy Scikit-learn NumPy Pandas Matplotlib Business Applications Business Applications differ from standard applications. E-commerce example business application. This kind application requires extensively, scalability readability, Python provides these features. Oddo example all-in-one Python-based application which offers range business applications. Python provides Tryton platform which used develop business application. Audio Video-based Applications Python flexible perform multiple tasks used create multimedia applications. Some multimedia applications which made using Python TimPlayer, cplay, etc. multimedia libraries given below. Gstreamer Pyglet Phonon Applications (Computer-aided design) used design engineering related architecture. used develop representation part system. Python create application using following functionalities. Fandango (Popular CAMVOX HeeksCNC AnyCAD RCAM Enterprise Applications Python used create applications that used within Enterprise Organization. Some real-time applications OpenERP, Tryton, Picalo, etc. Image Processing Application Python contains many libraries that used work with image. image manipulated according requirements. Some libraries image processing given below.
