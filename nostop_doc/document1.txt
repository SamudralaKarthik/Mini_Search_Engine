next prev Python Features Python provides many useful features which make popular valuable from other programming languages. supports object-oriented programming, procedural programming approaches provides dynamic memory allocation. have listed below essential features. Easy Learn Python easy learn compared other programming languages. syntax straightforward much same English language. There semicolon curly-bracket, indentation defines code block. recommended programming language beginners. Expressive Language Python perform complex tasks using lines code. simple example, hello world program simply type print("Hello World"). will take only line execute, while Java takes multiple lines. Interpreted Language Python interpreted language; means Python program executed line time. advantage being interpreted language, makes debugging easy portable. Cross-platform Language Python equally different platforms such Windows, Linux, UNIX, Macintosh, etc. that Python portable language. enables programmers develop software several competing platforms writing program only once. Free Open Source Python freely available everyone. freely available official website www.python.org. large community across world that dedicatedly working towards make python modules functions. Anyone contribute Python community. open-source means, "Anyone download source code without paying penny." Object-Oriented Language Python supports object-oriented language concepts classes objects come into existence. supports inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc. object-oriented procedure helps programmer write reusable code develop applications less code. Extensible implies that other languages such C/C++ used compile code thus used further Python code. converts program into byte code, platform that byte code. Large Standard Library provides vast range libraries various fields such machine learning, developer, also scripting. There various machine learning libraries, such Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, Pytorch, etc. Django, flask, pyramids popular framework Python development. Programming Support Graphical User Interface used developing Desktop application. PyQT5, Tkinter, Kivy libraries which used developing application. Integrated easily integrated with languages like C++, JAVA, etc. Python runs code line line like C,C++ Java. makes easy debug code. Embeddable code other programming language Python source code. Python source code another programming language well. embed other language into code. Dynamic Memory Allocation Python, don't need specify data-type variable. When assign some value variable, automatically allocates memory variable time. Suppose assigned integer value then don't need write Just write Next TopicPython History prev next
