next prev convert List Set? Sets Lists data structures Python that consist groups data elements. However, these data structures have some significant differences too. specific, lists perform ranges mathematical operations that useful search particular elements specifically with duplicates managing data. contrast, sets helpful perform variety functions like unions intersections. There many reasons have complete list conversion Python, this done using simple function. before started, understand some concepts Lists Sets. Lists Python Lists Python utilized store more than data element single variable. Lists among four built-in data types Python used accumulate collections data. rest three includes Sets, Tuples, Dictionary, these data types have different abilities usage. create Lists using square brackets. consider following example understand List. Example: Creating list eight elements mylist ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Orange", "Guava", "Mango", "Strawberry", "Grapes"] print(mylist) Output: ['Apple', 'Mango', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Guava', 'Mango', 'Strawberry', 'Grapes'] Explanation: above example, have created list eight elements using square brackets enclosing elements. have then printed list users. Moreover, also observe that element repeated list, which implies that List elements ordered, changeable, allows duplicate values. indexing List elements begins with first element, second element, Sets Python Sets also utilized store more than element single variable. Sets among four core data types Python that used accumulate collections data. unordered unindexed collection that written with curly brackets. consider following example understand Set. Example: Creating eight elements myset {"Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Orange", "Guava", "Pineapple", "Strawberry", "Grapes"} print(myset) Output: {'Strawberry', 'Mango', 'Grapes', 'Pineapple', 'Apple', 'Orange', 'Guava', 'Banana'} Explanation: above example, have created eight elements using curly brackets enclosing elements. have then printed users. Note: Sets unordered collection data. Hence, can't sure which order elements will appear. Understanding difference between Lists Sets most significant difference between list Python that only stores unique items, whereas list consist identical elements. instance, suppose have list mathematic test marks defined "marks [25, 20]", list displays user every value; however, when convert list into set, will remove duplicates leave {25, 20}. Another significant difference that sets curly brackets, whereas lists square brackets. Note: Things might confusing dictionary Python also utilizes curly brackets. However, each data element consists value itself colon separating "key". point remember that utilize integers, strings, floats, other objects fragment list mixed them same list set. Thus, similar having integers Python, also create strings Python more. Converting List into process converting list into Python easy simple. first, have define list. instance, suppose have list names defined the_names ["George", "Josh", "James", "Mark", "Carlo", "James", "Andy", "Sara", "Andy", "Victor"]. convert list into using set() command, where have insert list name between parentheses that needed converted. Hence, above case, have type set(the_names) order convert names, present list into set. Moreover, assign this function variable such "the_unique_names" show result users. also print( set( the_names)) function make more efficient. understand same using following example: Example: Creating list data elements the_names ["George", "Josh", "James", "Mark", "Carlo", "James", "Andy", "Sara", "Andy", "Victor"] Converting above list the_unique_names set( the_names) Printing users print( the_unique_names) Output: {'Victor', 'George', 'Josh', 'Andy', 'Mark', 'Carlo', 'Sara', 'James'} Explanation: above example, have defined list the_names containing data elements. have then defined variable the_unique_names that set() command convert list into set. last, have printed set. result, list been converted successfully. also observe that names such James Andy have been printed only once.
