Biopython Module: Installation Now, will learn about implementation functioning Python program. have first install Biopython Module system, then only will able import functions this module Python program. Therefore, will learn here about installation process Biopython Module system, will also check compatibility Python installed device. This because Biopython Module supported Python version above equal 2.5, Python having version lesser than support installation importing Biopython Module. That's first should make sure that Python installed system higher requisite latest versions. Now, don't know version Python installed system want check then following command command prompt terminal: python --version When press enter key, version Python installed system will displayed, output image. displayed version, that version Python installed system higher than required version. somehow version Python present system equal higher than required version, i.e., Python version 2.5, then should first update then only proceed with installation part. Note: There many other ways check version Python installed system, will prefer this this easiest simplest method. Now, after checking version Python installed system, will look forward installing Biopython module, will installer install this module. will following installer command command prompt terminal install Biopython Module system: install biopython When press enter after writing command, installer will start installing Biopython Module system. Biopython Module successfully installed system, import into Python program functions learn implementation. Biopython Module: Implementation learn Biopython Module works helps parsing bioinformatics files, have first create sample FASTA file (Here 'fasta' referred file format sequence originated from bioinformatics software). FASTA file format, sequence file arranged one, each sequence present file will have name, description actual sequence data. will first have open notepad present system write down following content Now, have save this notepad file with name 'SampleFile1.fasta', have save this same directory where Python installed that don't have write whole directory while opening file.
