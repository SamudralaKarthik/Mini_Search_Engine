next prev Algorithm Implementation Algorithm using Python this tutorial, will learn about algorithm using Python programming language. This algorithm primarily used search pattern sub-string with O(n) complexity. This algorithm asked technical interviews test developer's abilities. Algorithm stands Knuth-Morris-Prat pattern searching algorithm. This used solve string matching problem. This simple problem application areas Information Security, Pattern Recognition, Document Matching, Bioinformatics, etc. developed Donald-Knuth Vaughan Pratt conceiving linear time solution 1970 thoroughly analyzing naï¿½ve approach. Partial Match Table Partial match table KMP. understand KMP, need grasp concept partial match table. this section, will explain partial match table simple words. Let's following example char: index: value: have string eight-character pattern, partial match table will have eight cells. seventh cell table, means only interesting first seven characters pattern. eighth ("a") irrelevant. same will happen with sixth cell. Now, talk about meaning, need know about proper prefix proper suffixes. Let's what these term. Proper prefix characters string, with more end. "T", "Ti", "Tig", "Tige", "Tiger" proper prefix "Tiger". Proper suffix: characters string, with more beginning. "arry", "rry", "rr", "ry", proper suffixes "Harry". length longest proper prefix sub(pattern) that matches proper suffix same (sub)pattern. Let's understand using example. Suppose looking third cell, means only interested first three characters ("aba"). "aba", there proper prefixes ("a" "ab") proper suffixes ("a" "ba"). that proper prefix "ab" doesn't match either proper suffixes. However, proper prefix matches proper suffix "a". Thus, length longest proper prefix that matches proper suffix this case let's check cell five, which concerns "ababa" which have proper prefixes ('a', 'ab', 'aba', 'abab') four proper prefixes ('a', 'ba', 'aba', 'baba'). proper prefixes proper suffixes. Since aba longer than wins, cell fives gets value Next TopicNew Features Python 3.10 prev next
