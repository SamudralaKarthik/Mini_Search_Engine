next prev extract Lyrics from song Using Tkinter Python this tutorial, will create Python program extract song's lyrics connect them application. just entering song's name, lyrics-extractor will extract song's title lyrics from variety websites return them project novices which will knowledge extract data from JSON APIs these ideas practical project. About application words song extracted using lyric extractor. project, user will input music title, application will then requests JSON libraries extract song's lyrics from certain links. this will made possible building perform this operation. will need install lyrics-extractor module before continuing with program. will using terminal execute this command. install lyrics-extractor Requirements will needing Google Custom Search JSON Engine key. Engine obtain Engine will creating Custom Search Engine here. lyrics, must build Programmable Search Engine (Google Custom Search Engine) include link. Google's primary search technology foundation Programmable Search Engine. serves search engine your website charged with helping users locate information. acquire your search engine, select following links https://genius.com/ http://www.lyricsted.com/ http://www.lyricsbell.com/ https://www.glamsham.com/ http://www.lyricsoff.com/ http://www.lyricsmint.com/ JSON Programmable Search Engine's search results retrieved shown using custom search JSON API. Programmable Search Engine must created order custom search JSON API. your clicking this link https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview Approach Bring modules from lyrics_extractor import SongLyrics Enter SongLyrics() using Google Custom Search JSON Engine extracting_lyrics SongLyrics(GCS_API_KEY, GCS_ENGINE_ID) including song name parameter extracting_lyrics.get lyrics() function, obtain lyrics. extracting_lyrics.get_lyrics("I'll there you") Code this approach import required modules into program from lyrics_extractor import SongLyrics passing GCS_API_KEY, GCS_ENGINE_ID SongLyrics() method extracting_lyrics SongLyrics("AFteRqbcjskskyOw0oPesv","gsotsotstlex") extracting_lyrics.get_lyrics("Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyar Kya Karein Lyrics") Output Note While entering Engine code must enter avoid error generation. Extracting Lyrics using Tkinter project quite easy work makes modules like requests, tkinter google client. establish connection retrieve necessary search result, utilise Google Client, Tkinter build GUI. extract lyrics from obtained result, requests employed. This built-in library called Requests. will also require Engine when building project. When extracting lyrics, SongLyrics() function will them. With help websites provided below, generate Engine link mentioned earlier used your unique this link used your unique Engine https://cse.google.com/cse/create/new security purposes, advisable generate fresh Engine must include name website will utilising extract lyrics when generating Engine better results, enter many website urls like have mentioned earlier. Walking through code importing required modules from Python standard library from tkinter import from lyrics_extractor import SongLyrics Firstly, imported modules that required program like Tkinter lyrics_extractor class from SongLyrics into code. Defining method lyrics song getting_lyrics(): extracting_lyrics SongLyrics( "Aefgsdweamdhgpo-cdNlOq0oYird", "bewbewewbrdfewb") variable extracting storing lyrics song extracting_lyrics.getting_lyrics(str(ent.get())) final var['lyrics'] result.set(final) Then, defines function getting_lyrics() extract song's lyrics along with entering Engine using songLyrics() method. Then, created variable called extracting lyrics holding them temporarily finally stored result final variable permanently. Main code creating instance tkinter module base Tk() Setting colour light grey base.configure(bg 'light grey') Defining Variable Classes tkinter result StringVar() Next, main code defined window base instance Tkinter library background colour window light grey, using configure() method. Then, created variable called result store outcome. Creating label song's name with help Label widget Label(base, text "Enter Song name "light grey").grid(row sticky Creating label song's lyrics with help Label widget Label(base, text "Result "light grey").grid(row sticky Then, created labels using Label widgets entering song name displaying resulting lyrics. create precisely, mentioned parameters base, text Moreover, position them, used grid() method with parameters sticky. Creating another label variable classes name with help Entry widget Label(base, text="", textvariable result, "light grey").grid(row column sticky Entry(base, width=50) ent.grid(row column Then, added another label using Label widget entry boxes using Entry widget enter display text positioned them using grid() method along with parameters like row, column sticky. Setting button with help button widget Button(base, text "Show", command getting_lyrics, "Blue") btn.grid(row column columnspan rowspan padx pady lastly, created Show button using Button widget showing extracted lyrics song. used grid() method position window with help various parameters like row, column, columnspan, rowspan, padx pady. Complete Code Python program create extract lyrics from song using Tkinter importing required modules from Python standard library from tkinter import from lyrics_extractor import SongLyrics Defining method lyrics song getting_lyrics(): extracting_lyrics SongLyrics( "Aefgsdweamdhgpo-cdNlOq0oYird", "bewbewewbrdfewb") variable extracting storing lyrics song extracting_lyrics.getting_lyrics(str(ent.get())) final var['lyrics'] result.set(final) Main code creating instance tkinter module base Tk() Setting colour light grey base.configure(bg 'light grey') Defining Variable Classes tkinter result StringVar() Creating label song's name with help Label widget Label(base, text "Enter Song name "light grey").grid(row sticky Creating label song's lyrics with help Label widget Label(base, text "Result "light grey").grid(row sticky Creating another label variable classes name with help Entry widget Label(base, text="", textvariable result, "light grey").grid(row column sticky Entry(base, width=50) ent.grid(row column Setting button with help button widget Button(base, text "Show", command getting_lyrics, "Blue") btn.grid(row column columnspan rowspan padx pady Executing mainloop() Output output extract lyrics from song attached below form screenshot. Conclusion result, started from scratch with basic Python Extract Song Lyrics Project. project serves fantastic introduction scraping, tkinter design, utilising Google client build customized search engine.
