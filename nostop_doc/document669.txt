next prev Iterate through List Python Lists most used data structures Python. keep using lists many different applications, from solving simple problems complex problems. Python, lists replace arrays with advantages like: Dynamic size store items different data types single list access data simply from lists ordered; unlike sets, data will unordered. access data, several ways iterate through each element inside list. This tutorial covers ways with examples. Loops Using while loop: list1 count while (count len(list1)): print (list1 [count]) count count Output: Understanding: created list with elements. Initially, count We're printing element 'count' index incrementing count while loop. When count reaches length list, loop will terminated, elements will already accessed. Mechanism: count list1 count list1 count list1 count list1 count list1 count (list1) Using loop: list1 list1: print Output: Understanding: Using for-in, accessed i's, elements inside list. Using range: list1 length (list1) range (list1)): print (list1 [i]) Output: Understanding: range function helps 'for' loop iterate from given list's length. Mechanism: range gives list1 range gives list1 range gives list1 range gives list1 range gives list1 range function doesn't give last element specified (list1) given. Using List Comprehension This simple suggested iterate through list Python. Code: list1 [print list1] print ("\n") [print (list1 [i]) range (list1))] print ("\n") Output: Understanding: loops inside list comprehension. used same loops used above examples inside list single line. This way, reduce length code also list comprehension very subtle efficient loops lists. Using enumerate(): enumerate function converts given list into list tuples. Another important fact about this function that keeps count iterations. This built-in function Python. Code: list1 enumerate (list1): print ("index "value: Output: Using lambda function map(): These anonymous functions. There function Python that accept function argument, calls function with every element iterable, list with elements from iterable will returned. Code: list1 result list (map (lambda num: num, list1)) print (result) Output: Understanding: lambda num: given input function along with list. function will take every single element list, accept then return function will pass list elements lambda function return elements. What want Iterate Multi-dimensional Lists? There inbuilt module Python designed perform operations multi-dimensional lists. numpy: Check Python installed opening search typing commands: Python -version --version both Python present system, time install library: Open from start menu Type command install numpy library packages, data, sub-packages will installed after other. Code: import numpy list1 numpy. arange list1 list1. reshape numpy. nditer (list1): print Output: Understanding: imported numpy module. Using arrange method, created array with elements. accessed list reshaping (rows columns) using reshape. Using nditer function, printed each element list. Next TopicHow Learn Python Online prev next
