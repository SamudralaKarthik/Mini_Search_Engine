next prev Python this tutorial, will discuss library Python programming language order design user interface Python programs with help HTML, CSS, JavaScript. have divided tutorial into sections. first section based fundamental theory library. contrast, have shown implementation library other section creating simple application that accepts integers input from user returns their sum. Understanding Python Library small library Python programming language that allows programmers create simple Electron-like offline Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications based HTML JavaScript with complete access capabilities libraries Python. capable hosting local webserver, then allows programmers annotate methods functions Python that call them from JavaScript vice versa. This library designed order take disturbance writing simple short applications. consider figure depicting concept Eel. files HTML, CSS, JavaScript stored same directory initialized with help python program. file enables connection between HTML page Python using functions activated onclick events from HTML page. Implementation Library following section deals with making simple application with help library demonstration purposes. idea behind application that program accepts numbers from HTML page, adds them Python, shows output user. before start creating application, install library. will using installer order install required library. syntax same shown below: Syntax: $pip install Next, will using Visual Studio Code this project creation. have created folder named "Web_test". Within that folder, have created another folder named "myWeb". This folder will store following files: html js-file.js HML page, will creating three text areas button. consider following snippet code same. File: myWebpage.html <html> <head> <title> Application </title> <script type "text/javascript" "js-file.js"></script> <script type "text/javascript" "/eel.js"></script> </head> <body> <label>Enter First Number <textarea "int1"></textarea> <label>Enter Second Number <textarea "int2"></textarea> <label>Result <textarea "res"></textarea> <button type "button" "add" onclick "summation()"> </button> </body> </html> Explanation: above snippet code, have created HTML page where have defined three text areas with different IDs. 'int1' 'int2' input from user, 'res' text area display result. button with 'sum' onclick function attached defined file. Now, consider snippet code file. File: js-file.js document.querySelector("button").onclick function summation(){ data_1 document.getElementById("int1").value data_2 document.getElementById("int2").value eel.add(data_1, data_2)(call_Back) function call_Back(output){ document.getElementById("res").value output Explanation: above snippet code, have defined function summation() that activated through onclick event. Within function, have fetched value 'int1' 'int2' passed them 'sum' function, which will defined Python file. function named call_Back() accepts 'output' argument returned Python method named "sum". This 'output' returned text area with 'res'. Now, consider snippet code Python file. File: my_sum.py importing library import initializing application eel.init("myWeb") using eel.expose command @eel.expose defining function addition numbers add(data_1, data_2): int1 int(data_1) int2 int(data_2) output int1 int2 return output starting application eel.start("myWebpage.html") Explanation: above snippet code, have imported library initialized application with help eel.init("folder name") command, where have assigned "myweb" name folder. have then used eel.expose command under which have defined "add" function, which will 'data_1' with 'data_2' return resultant value "output". value stored "output" fetched "call_Back" function file placed HTML webpage. have then initialized application with help eel.start("html filename") command, specifying name file "myWebpage.html". save python file execute using following syntax order result Syntax: python my_sum.py following figure displays designed User Interface. Output: Explanation: default, Python library utilizes Google Chrome browser order application; however, also mention browser with help 'mode' option. Along with 'mode', there other application choices available like 'position', 'size', 'geometry', more, which passed inside eel.start() command. Conclusion above tutorial, have discussed library usage Python. have learned that this library helps programmers create offline application based HTML JavaScript. With help library, capabilities Python, including freedom design User Interface with HTML well CSS. Although according popularity, below main competitor, Electron; however, there many programmers whose first choice order create simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications.
