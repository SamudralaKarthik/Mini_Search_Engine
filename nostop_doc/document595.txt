next prev Python Bitwise Operators general, Python operators often used handle values arguments. This tutorial will explore specific form Python operator called bitwise operators. These symbols indicate conventional symbols mathematical logical procedures. Bitwise Operators Bitwise operations processes that engage with individual bits, which fundamental constituent sort data computer. binary value assigned each bit. Regardless notion that machines manipulate bits, machines usually store data perform commands bytes, which multiples. Most scripting languages work with groups bits, bits, bits. Bitwise operators characters that denote operations that performed single bits. bitwise operation executed spatially aligning distinct bits two-bit patterns same size. Bitwise Operators Python Bitwise operators employed python perform bitwise operations numbers. values first converted binary, then manipulations done bit, hence phrase "bitwise operators." outcome then displayed decimal numbers. Bitwise Logical Operator: These operators employed execute logical operations like other logical operators bit. This akin using logical operators such and, level. Except these basic facts, bitwise logical operators analogous. Bitwise Shift Operators: These operators multiply divide integer number shifting every individual left right. them when wish multiply divide value power Python's bitwise operators only work with integers. Operator Description Binary TThe operator sends present both operands output. Binary TIf present either operand, copied. Binary copied inside argument both. Binary Ones Complement function 'flipping' bits unary. Binary Left Shift TThe left operand's value moved left number bits specified right argument. Binary Right Shift quantity bits provided right parameter advances position left operand. Every binary bitwise operator compound operator that performs enhanced application. Operator Syntax Equivalent These rules updating left-hand argument whilst it's still active. Examples Bitwise Operators Python Bitwise logical conjunction performed bitwise operation appropriate bits provided operands. Code Bitwise operation print("x Output: Bitwise Logical disjunction achieved using bitwise operation (|). minimum, appropriate pair bits turned yields one. Code #Bitwise operation print("x Output: Bitwise Because bitwise operator only requires parameter, this only unary bitwise operator. flips bits number given implement logical negation upon Code #Bitwise operation print("~x ~x) Output: -44 Bitwise When bits another returns true; otherwise, returns false. Code #Bitwise operation print("x Output: Bitwise Right Shift result this operation, individual bits number shifted right, gaps left filled with number negative). result similar dividing value power Code -104 #Bitwise right shift operator print("x print("y Output: -13 Bitwise Left Shift result operation, individual bits integer left filled with voids right. result similar multiplying value power Code #Bitwise left shift operator print("x print("y Output: -30 Next TopicPython Time asctime() Method prev next
