next prev AttributeError Python What Error? programming languages, execute some code invalid way, execution program will stopped with message this message called error exception. There certain types errors programming language different reasons. Some them follows: AssertionError: This type error occurs when assertion conditions statements fail code. ImportError: This error occurs when import some module file that module does exist. IndexError: occurs when sequence, index range. KeyError: This error raised Python when can't find dictionary. NameError: This error occur when find variable local global scope. RuntimeError: This error will raised when error cannot categorized type. IndentationError: When wrong indentation Python code, then IndentationError will occur. SystemError: When there internal error, then SystemError will raised interpreter. UnicodeError: When there encoding decoding error related Unicode UnicodeError will raised. ValueError: When function, pass correct argument according data type, value proper, then error that occurred called ValueError. ZeroDivisionError: know, math, cannot divide number zero because result tends infinity. have written statement regarding division zero modulo zero, then error raised will ZeroDivisionError. EOFError: When input() function input from file, reach file, then this error will raised indicate that have reached file, cannot take input from file. This article mainly dedicated AttributeError. What AttributeError? This error occurs program when there conditioning failure attribute assignment. example, assign integer variable some value string function from that variable, then will raise AttributeError. understand reason AttributeError Python following examples: Example When apply function different data type which possible a=15 a.append("javatpoint") Output: Explanation: above code, have integer variable, have initialized with value Now, append function variable then will give AttributeError, which says that there attribute append integer data type. Example2: There chances AttributeError wrong spelling attribute. string "you will learn each coding tutorial from ".fst("Javatpoint") print(string) Output: Explanation: above code, have string attribute, apply fst attribute, there will AttributeError that this attribute does exist variable. Example3: AttributeError make wrong reference class variable. class Javatpoint(): 	def __init__(self): 		self.var1 'This JavatPoint' Javatpoint() print(obj.var1) print(obj.var2) Output: Explanation: above code, have class, there variable named var1. create object class, mistake, reference wrong variable var2 that class which even does exist, there will definitely AttributeError. solution tackle error exception: Python programming language, exception error handling using except statements. Example class Javatpoint(): 	def __init__(self): 		self.var1 'This javatpoint' Javatpoint() try: 	print(obj.var1) 	print(obj.var2) except AttributeError: 	print("There such attribute") Output: Explanation: above code, have class variable named var1. statement, reference var1 var2. will able dereference var1, will print statement will AttributeError referencing var2. program will into except block, will print statement, which written only error condition.
