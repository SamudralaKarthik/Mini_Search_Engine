next prev Python seaborn Library Seaborn amazing library visualization graphical statistical plotting Python. Seaborn provides many color palettes defaults beautiful styles make creation many statistical plots Python more attractive. Objective Python Seaborn library Seaborn library aims make more attractive visualization central part understanding exploring data. built core matplotlib library also provides dataset-oriented APIs. Seaborn also closely integrated with Panda's data structures, with this, easily jump between various different visual representations given variable better understand provided dataset. Categories Plots Python's seaborn library Plots generally used make visualization relationships between given variables. These variables either category like group, division, class completely numerical variables. There various different categories plots that create using seaborn library. seaborn library, plot that create divided into following various categories: Distribution plots: This type plot used examining both types distributions, i.e., univariate bivariate distribution. Relational plots: This type plot used understand relation between given variables. Regression plots: Regression plots seaborn library primarily intended additional visual guide that will help emphasize dataset patterns during analysis exploratory data. Categorical plots: categorical plots used deals with categories variables visualize them. Multi-plot grids: multi-plot grids also type plot that useful approach draw multiple instances same plot with different subsets single dataset. Matrix plots: matrix plots type arrays scatterplots. Installation seaborn library Python Here, will learn install seaborn library Python. After installing seaborn library, import into Python program Python. install seaborn Required dependencies prerequisites seaborn library: must have, Python installed with latest version (3.6+). Numpy must installed with version 1.13.3 higher. SciPy must installed with 1.0.1 higher versions. Must have panda library with 0.22.0 higher versions. statsmodel library must installed with version 0.8.0 higher. should have matplotlib installed with 2.1.2 higher versions. Now, will learn about some basic plots examples that plot Python using seaborn library. Plotting Chart Using seaborn Library Line plot: seaborn line plot most basic plots presents seaborn library. seaborn line plot mainly visualize given data some time-series form, i.e., continuous manner with respect time. Example Importing seaborn library program import seaborn Importing mataplotlib library show graph output import matplotlib.pyplot Setting style with set() function sns.set(style="dark") Using dataset() function declare data type FMR sns.load_dataset("fmri") Plotting various responses different\ Regions events sns.lineplot(x="timepoint", y="signal", hue="region", style="event", data=FMR) using lineplot() function create line plot plt.show() using show() function Output: Explanation: above code, after setting dataset fmri type setting style line plot, lineplot() function draw line plot output. Dist plot: seaborn dist plots plot histograms with given variables data result. plot histograms with some other variations such rugplot kdeplot using dist plot. Example importing numpy library module import numpy Importing seaborn library program import seaborn Importing mataplotlib library show graph output import matplotlib.pyplot Selecting style boxplot with set() function sns.set(style="white") Generate random univariate type distribution ru np.random.RandomState(10) ru.normal(size=100) Plotting simple histogram with kdeplot variation sns.histplot(d, kde=True, color="m") plot sns.histplot(d, kde=True, color="m") print(plot) plt.show() using show() function Output: Lmplot: Lmplot another basic plots seaborn library. Lmplot shows line that represents linear regression model with data points given two-dimensional (2-D) space. this space, variables vertical horizontal labels, respectively. Example Importing seaborn library program import seaborn Importing matplotlib library show graph output import matplotlib.pyplot Using set() function style sns.set(style="ticks") Using dataset() function sns.load_dataset("anscombe") Showing results form linear regression sns.lmplot(x="x", y="y", data=ds) plot sns.lmplot(x="x", y="y", data=ds) print(plot) plt.show() using show() function Output: <seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid object 0x000002182DC89070> Next TopicCountplot Python prev next
