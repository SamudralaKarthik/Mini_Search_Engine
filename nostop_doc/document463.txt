next prev Celery Tutorial Using Python: Must Learn Technology Python Developer this tutorial, will discuss most popular, must learn technology Python developers. Everybody Python developer association learned about Celery implemented least once. fast internet, users want load page instantaneously result seconds. small tasks executed within second microseconds, heavy task take many seconds even minute. here question arises, provide fast user experience while complicated task still loading? Here asynchronous programming comes into play. Celery used parallel execution task. Celery provides facility program/jobs background when sitting ideal. Before diving deeper this topic, let's understand core concept Celery this tutorial, will discuss following concepts Celery. What Celery? does work? What Tasks Queues? What Message Brokers? this Useful? does work? Features Celery Getting Started with Celery What Celery? Celery open-source Python library which used tasks asynchronously. task queue that holds tasks distributes them workers proper manner. primarily focused real-time operation also supports scheduling (run regular interval tasks). enhances end's user activity amazingly. Celery introduces various message brokers such RabbitMQ Redis. Celery combines various frameworks, including Flask, Pylons, web2py, Tryton, Tornado. useful? Suppose need access every minute (hour), want send multiple emails day. Celery schedule that type periodic task easily. Let's take another scenario: user sends request, page taking long load. Meanwhile, Celery decreases page load time running part functionality postponed tasks same server sometime different server. Celery's workers then update callbacks, process files, send emails, make changes database many more. main advantage Celery that application continue respond client requests. end-users don't have wait unnecessarily. Does Celery Works? traditional HTTP request-response cycle, when send request server through client, server sends response client. works appropriately small tasks, become slow when load large tasks. Hence, need implement functionality that decrease load time. Let's understand working scenario Celery. Celery interacts messages; normally broker works mediate between clients workers. inward working Celery affirms Producer Consumer pattern. Celery three chief elements high level. Producers Producers 'web nodes' that manages requests. When application processing, tasks assigned Celery means forced into task queue. Consumer Consumers 'worker nodes' that monitors queue head, workers take tasks perform Workers perform various tasks well; hence they also behave producers. Queue basically message broker which acts bridge between producer consumer. essentially passes messages between application Celery workers. Celery wide support RabbitMQ Redis, also helps Zookeeper, Amazon with confined abilities. Features Celery Celery handy structure that decreases production load through delayed tasks, prepares asynchronous planned jobs. Following some important features Celery. Open-source Library Python Celery open-source free software. This feature attracts organizations developers celery solve their tasks without paying penny. Straight Forward Installation lightweight simple library installed easily. install from terminal using command "pip install Celery". Scheduling specify particular time task using datetime module along with celery beat. celery beat trigger tasks regular intervals. periodic task repeated events based simple interval. Broker Support Celery supports multiple message brokers, popularly RabbitMQ also supports Amazon lacks some features (monitoring remote control). Integration with Frameworks Celery also incorporates with various Python frameworks such Pyramid, Pylons, Django, Tornado, Trylons, Flask. Fast Celery process millions tasks within minute. Works-flow compose simple complex works flows using advance primitives which known "canvas". Getting Started with Celery this tutorial, will implement Celery with Django, where will create simple task queue. Let's start following below steps. Create Django Project First, will create Django project named learn_celery celery_django folder. first will create virtual environment. dependencies will stored virtual env. C:\Users\User\Desktop\celery_django>python venv myenv Once virtual environment created, will activate using below command. C:\Users\User\Desktop\celery_django>myenv/bin/activate Install Django using below command. install django After installation Django, create project. creating project named learn_celery using below command. C:\Users\User\Desktop\celery_django>django-admin startproject learn-celery familiar create project Django, visit Django tutorial. Now, ready install Celery virtual environment. Installation install Celery using below command. install celery After celery installation, will configure Celery Django project. Celery Configuration Open project's settings.py file below configuration. using redis message broker. Celery Settings CELERY_BROKER_URL 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379' CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT ['application/json'] CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER 'json' CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER 'json'CELERY_TIMEZONE 'Asia/Kolkata' Choosing Broker Brokers separate services that enable applications, systems, services communicate share information. Let's simplify this term assign tasks workers message queue. message queue first-in, first-out data structure which means message stored first place will executed first. tasks will perform order that them. this tutorial, will Redis Message Broker. Redis Installation Windows Installation Redis Mac/Ubuntu pretty straightforward slightly tricky Window. here describing install redis Windows. Visit Github link https://github.com/tporadowski/redis/releases, click Redis-x64-5.0.14.msi. will download .msi file. Click downloaded setup. will automatically install redis your system drive. Once installed, open redis-cli type PING. Redis dependency also required celery program. install redis dependency using below command. install redis Once installation completed, fire server using below command. redis-server test whether Redis working properly typing following command terminal. redis-cli ping replies with PONG, working fine. D:\celery> redis-cli ping PONG Note Celery Redis installed using single command which given below. install Celery[Redis] Create celery.py file open celery.py file Django project below code. Celery.py import from celery import Celery from celery.schedules import crontab default Django settings module 'celery' program. os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'learn_django.settings') #pass project name Celery(project_name) Celery('learn_django') Using string here means worker doesn't have serialize configuration object child processes. namespace='CELERY' means celery-related configuration keys should have `CELERY_` prefix. app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY') #Celery Beat Settings app.conf.beat_schedule 'send-mail-every-day-at-8' 'task': 'emailExample.tasks.send_mail_func', 'schedule': crontab(hour minute 42), Load task modules from registered Django apps. app.autodiscover_tasks() @app.task(bind=True) debug_task(self): print(f'Request: {self.request!r}') Create Celery Task celery tasks created tasks.py Django app/project. create working directory using below command. C:\Users\User\Desktop\celery_django>python manage.py startapp celeryApp Once application created, create task.py file create task. tasks regular Python functions that called with Celery. example create function that will print integer number. rom celery import shared_task @shared_task(bind=True) test_func(self): range(10): print(i) return "Completed" create view view.py file. view.py from django.http import HttpResponse importing task from tasks.py file from .tasks import test_func Create your views here. test(request): call test_function using delay, calling task test_func.delay() return HttpResponse("Done") will this view urls.py file. CeleryApp/urls.py from django.urls import path urlpatterns path('', test, name='test'), Note celery result, install following third-party register settings.py file. install django-celery-result ready execute first asynchronous task. python manage.py runserver click local host link http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Running Celery Locally open terminal navigate project directory, activate virtual env. start celery worker following command. D:\celeryPython> celery -A CeleryDjango.celery worker --pool=solo info that Celery started ready perform background jobs. Redis message broker running 6379 port default.
