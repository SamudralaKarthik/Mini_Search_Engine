next prev Average list Python this tutorial, will discuss compute average list Python. average list defined elements present list divided number elements present list. Here, will make three different approaches calculate average elements present list using Python. Using sum() Using reduce() Using mean() let's startedâ€¦ Using sum() first method, have used sum() len() calculate average. following program illustrates same- Python program average list calc_average(lst): 	return sum(lst) len(lst) [24, average calc_average(lst) Printing average value list print("The average list round(average, Output: average list 34.5 Explanation- It's time have look what have done above program- first step, have created function that takes list parameter then returns average using sum() len(). know that sum() used calculate elements len() tells about length list. After this, have initialized list whose average, would like calculate. next step, have passed this list parameter function. Finally, printed resultant value. next program, will reduce() help same. Using reduce() program given below shows done- Python program obtain average list Using reduce() lambda from functools import reduce calc_average(lst): 	return reduce(lambda lst) len(lst) #initializing list [24, average calc_average(lst) Printing average list print("The Average list round(average, Output: average list 34.5 Explanation Let's understand what have done here- first step, have imported reduce from functools that program compute average elements. Now, have created function calc_average that takes list parameter uses lambda(a precise writing functions python) inside reduce calculate average. After this have initialized whose average, would like calculate. next step, have passed this list parameter function. Finally, printed resultant value. last program, will learn mean() used calculate average list Using mean() following program shows done- Python program obtain average list Using mean() from statistics import mean calc_average(lst): 	return mean(lst) [24, average calc_average(lst) Printing average list print("The average list round(average, Output: average list 34.5 Explanation- It's time have look what have done above program- first step, have imported mean from statistics that program compute average elements. Now, have created function calc_average that takes list parameter uses mean() calculate average. After this have initialized whose average, would like calculate. next step, have passed this list parameter function. Finally, printed resultant value. Conclusion this tutorial, learned different methods calculating average elements present list using Python. Next TopicAppend Extend Insert Python prev next
