next prev Python Before discussing about vif, essential understand first what multicollinearity linear regression? situation multicollinearity arises when independent variables have strong correlation. Whenever perform exploratory data analysis, objective obtain significant parameter that affects target variable. Therefore, correlation major step that helps understand linear relationship that exists between variables. What Correlation? Correlation measures scope which variables interdependent. visual idea checking what kind correlation exists between variables. plot graph interpret does rise value attribute affects other attribute. Concerning statistics, obtain correlation using Pearson Correlation. gives correlation coefficient P-value. have look criteria- CORRELATION COEFFICIENT RELATIONSHIP Close Large Positive Close Large Negative Close relationship exists P-VALUE CERTAINITY P-value<0.001 Strong P-value<0.05 Moderate P-value<0.1 Weak P-value>0.1 Since have detailed idea correlation, understood that strong correlation exists between independent variables dataset, leads multicollinearity. Let's discuss what kind issues occur because multicollinearity- Since there strong relationship, determining significant variables would difficult task. coefficients that will obtain variables unstable consequence, interpretation model would tedious job. Overfitting might occur accuracy model would change with dataset. Checking Multicollinearity methods checking multicollinearity are- Plotting heatmap comprehend correlation Variance Inflation Factor Plotting heatmap comprehend correlation Taking dataset, plotting heatmap will help infer which attribute most significant value correlation. This value will tell extent influence between dependent variable independent variable. have look program that shows implemented. Example import matplotlib.pyplot import pandas import seaborn importing data pd.read_csv("/content/SampleSuperstore.csv") print(df.corr()) plotting correlation heatmap df_plot sns.heatmap(df.corr(), cmap="YlGnBu", annot=True) displaying heatmap plt.show() Output: Variance Inflation Factor Variance Inflation Factor measure multicollinearity that exists variables that involved multiple regressions. Generally, value above indicates that there high correlation with other independent variables. have look program that shows implemented. Example from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor from statsmodels.tools.tools import add_constant import pandas pd.DataFrame( {'x': 'y': 'z': 'w': 5]} add_constant(df) ds=pd.Series([variance_inflation_factor(X.values, range(X.shape[1])], index=X.columns) print(ds) Output: Different ways resolve issue Multicollinearity- Selection Variables variables should selected that ones which highly correlated removed make only significant variables. Transformation Variables Transformation variables integral step here motive maintain feature performing transformation give range that won't produce biased result. Principal Component Analysis Principal Component Analysis dimensionality reductions technique through which obtain significant features dataset that strongly influence target variable. thing that must take care while implementing that should lose essential features reduce them that gather maximum possible information.
