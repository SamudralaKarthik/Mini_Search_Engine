next prev Perfect Number Python Playing with numbers something that doing since childhood. basic arithmetic operations performed numbers generate valuable results. voyage learning, must give more emphasis logic develop mathematics they become foundation programming. this article, discuss what perfect number, what steps determine whether number perfect not, finally, shall program written Python. let's startedâ€¦ First, understand what perfect number? perfect number number which divisors number equal number. Make sure that have exclude number when calculating divisors. Now, will what steps involved determining perfect number. First all, will user input integer which will stored variable. Now, will declare variable called 'sum', where will store divisors given number. next task loop where will divide number with number initialized variable then we'll increment value check what numbers give remainder zero. These numbers will divisors. will take each divisors that number with variable 'sum'. Finally, will decision statement keyword 'if' compare number given user with value sum. values equal, will display result 'It's perfect number', else will display, 'It's perfect number'. It's time have look Python program- Example num=int(input("Enter number: sum_v=0 range(1,num): (num%i==0): sum_v=sum_v+i if(sum_v==num): print("The entered number perfect number") else: print("The entered number perfect number") Output: Enter number: entered number perfect number Enter number: entered number perfect number Explanation program given above, have- have variable 'num' asked user provide value. discussed earlier, have declared variable sum_v zero. Now, have used loop whose range from number provided user. next step check whether number when divided with numbers provided range gives remainder zero. Those values will added then stored variable sum_v. Finally, will make 'if' compare divisors with number display required result. this program, user given values desired output displayed. have look another program where will implement same with help function. Example num_perfect(num): sum_n range(1, num): sum_n=sum_n+i return sum_n print(num_perfect(25)) Output: False Explanation this program, have used steps similar ones discussed previous example, only difference here have defined function called providing value. Because return statement present function definition, gives value True False. this tutorial, learned about perfect numbers, process that must follow determine whether given number perfect not, discussed implementation Python.
