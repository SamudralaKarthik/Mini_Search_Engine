Application Knowing Region Phone Number know region given phone number, i.e., find from which country which area, given phone number belong. Geocoder library phonenumbers module provides description_for_number() function, which find region given phone number. this giving phone number argument inside function, then print region phone number result output. understand implementation description_for_number() function phonenumbers module through following example program. Example Look following program where have printed region given phone number output: Importing phonenumbers module import phonenumbers Importing geocoder library from phonenumbers module from phonenumbers import geocoder Parsing given phone number givenPN pn.parse("+919034xxxxxx") Using parse phone number finding region regionOfPN gc.description_for_number(givenPN, 'en') Printing region result print("The region given phone number regionOfPN) Output: region given phone number India see, region given phone number printed output, that's find print region given phone number. have hidden last digits phone number used example security personal reasons. Explanation: After importing phonenumbers module pt, have imported geocoder library phonenumbers module gc. After that, have parsed given phone number stored result initialized variable (givenPN) argument inside description_for_number() function. Then, used parsed number variable description_for_number() argument stored result second initialized variable. Inside description_for_number() function, have also used 'en' language specify English printing storing results. Lastly, printed result output using regionOfPN variable print statement. Application Finding Operator Given Phone Number: even find that given phone number belongs which card operator using phonenumbers module. carrier library phonenumbers module provides option find carrier phone number using name_for_number() function. name_for_number() function carrier library, have parse phone number argument, then print carrier given phone number output. understand implementation name_for_number() function phonenumbers module through following example program. Example Look following Python program where have printed sim card operator given phone number: Importing phonenumbers module import phonenumbers Importing carrier library from phonenumbers module from phonenumbers import carrier cr Parsing given phone number givenPN pn.parse("+919034xxxxxx") Using parse phone number finding carrier carrierOfPN cr.name_for_number(givenPN, 'en') Printing carrier result print("The Card operator carrier given phone number carrierOfPN) Output: Card operator carrier given phone number Tata Docomo see, carrier given phone number printed output, that's find print card operator given phone number. Explanation: have used parsed phone number variable inside name_for_number() function find carrier, lastly, printed result program output using result variable, i.e., carrierOfPN variable, print statement. Application Parsing Given Phone Number: Parsing given phone number means setting given phone number according phonenumbers module format. this operation using parse() function phonenumbers module providing phone number argument function. function will yield result providing given phone number phonenumbers format output. understand this parse() function through following example program where parse given phone number. Example Look following program where have used parse() function parse phone number: Importing phonenumbers module import phonenumbers Parsing given phone number givenPN pn.parse("+919034xxxxxx") Printing parsed phone number print("The given phone number after parsed will look like following format: print(givenPN) Output: given phone number after parsed will look like following format: Country Code: National Number: 9034xxxxxx see, have parsed given phone number program, this parse function parse phone number given argument. Note: have keep mind that given phone number argument parse() function should given with country code Application Getting Timezone Given Phone Number's Region: even timezone area from where given phone number belongs simply from given phone number. perform this task using phonenumbers module phonenumber module provide with timezone library, which used find timezone given phone number's area. timezone library phonenumbers module provides with time_zones_for_number() function, which find timezone phonenumber. have simply give parsed phone number argument time_zones_for_number(), thus, find timezone phone number print result output. understand implementation time_zones_for_number() function phonenumbers module through following example program. Example Look following Python program where have printed timezone given phone number output: Importing phonenumbers module import phonenumbers Importing timezone library from phonenumbers module from phonenumbers import timezone Parsing given phone number givenPN pn.parse("+919034xxxxxx") Using parse phone number finding timezone timezoneOfPN tz.time_zones_for_number(givenPN) Printing carrier result print("The timezone given phone number timezoneOfPN) Output: timezone given phone number ('Asia/Calcutta',) see, timezone given phone number printed output, that's find print timezone given phone number. Application Matching Extracting Phone Numbers: Sometimes have given multiple phone numbers, have find phone numbers particular country code region among them. this manually, will take time doing with help phonenumbers module saves time. Phonenumbers module provides with PhoneNumberMatcher object, which relevant function perform phone number matching tasks. PhoneNumberMatcher() function with some given phone numbers filter required phone numbers, then print them output. understand this implementation phonenumbers module with help following example program: Example Look following Python program where have performed extracting matching operations given phone numbers: Importing phonenumbers module import phonenumbers Defining multiple phone numbers sampleText "You contact +919034xxxxxx daytime reach night with +119876543210" Searching particular phone number resultPN pn.PhoneNumberMatcher(sampleText, "IN") Printing result output desiredPN resultPN: print(desiredPN) Output: PhoneNumberMatch [23,36) +919034xxxxxx see, have extracted particular region (India this example) phone number from given sample text printed output. That's PhoneNumberMatcher object match extract some particular phone number from given text. Explanation: After defining sample text which have mentioned different regions phone numbers), have used this sampleText variable PhoneNumberMatcher() function with "IN" argument that will find Indian regions phone numbers from sample text. After that, have printed result this search output using loop loop over resultPN variable. Application Validating Phone Number: even check that given phone number valid using phonenumbers module. Other than this, also check that given number possible not. performing both these tasks, phonenumbers provide with different functions i.e., is_valid_number() is_possible_number(). these functions determine validation possibility given phone number providing parsed phone number argument these functions. understand implementation both these functions through following example program. Example Look following program where have validated checked possibility given number: Importing phonenumbers module import phonenumbers Parsing given phone number givenPN pn.parse("+919034xxxxxx") Validating parsed number validNumber pn.is_valid_number(givenPN) Checking possibility number possibleNumber pn.is_possible_number(givenPN) Printing results output print("Is given phone number valid?: validNumber) print("Is given phone number possible?: possibleNumber) Output: given phone number valid?: True given phone number possible?: True see, validation possibility given number printed output, that's validate check possibility given phone number.
