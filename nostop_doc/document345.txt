next prev Remove Decimal Python have worked with different kind numbers Python modified their type need. this tutorial, will discuss remove decimal Python. Let's start with simple program, print(type(a)) 19.4 print(type(b)) 3+4j print(type(c)) Output: <class 'int'> <class 'float'> <class 'complex'> Explanation: above program, have declared a,b 19.4, 3+4j respectively. checking their type, came know belongs class 'int', belongs class 'float' belongs class 'complex'. Here have work float numbers, let's list different methods removing decimals from numbers. Using trunc() function Using int() Using split() Let's discuss each them detail- Using trunc() Function first program, will make trunc() function remove decimal present numbers. following program illustrates same- import math num_value1 math.trunc(523.771) print (num_value1) print (type(num_value1)) num_value2 math.trunc(21.67) print (num_value2) print (type(num_value2)) num_value3 math.trunc(182.33) print (num_value3) print (type(num_value3)) num_value4 math.trunc(211.54) print (num_value4) print (type(num_value4)) num_value5 math.trunc(19.1) print (num_value5) print (type(num_value5)) Output: <class 'int'> <class 'int'> <class 'int'> <class 'int'> <class 'int'> Explanation: Let's have look explanation above program- Since have trunc() function, have imported math module. have provided five different decimal values five variables checked their type after they passed trunc() function. executing program, displays required output. Using int() It's time know second approach which removing decimal using int(). program given below shows done- num_value1 523.771 num_value2 21.67 num_value3 182.33 print (type(num_value1)) print (type(num_value2)) print (type(num_value3)) new_value1 int(num_value1) new_value2 int(num_value2) new_value3 int(num_value3) print (new_value1) print (new_value2) print (new_value3) print (type(new_value1)) Output: <class 'float'> <class 'float'> <class 'float'> <class 'int'> Explanation: Let's understand what have done here- first step, have provided float values three variables checked their type. After this, have passed each variable int() stored them variable. Finally, have printed values stored these variables. executing this program, expected output displayed. Using split() Finally, last approach, will interesting split() obtain integer values. following program illustrates same- num_values=[523.771,21.67,182.33,211.54,19.1] sp_lst num_values: 	sp_lst.append(str(ele).split('.')[0]) res_list [int(i) sp_lst] print("The resultant list ",res_list) Output: resultant list [523, 182, 211, Explanation: Let's have look explanation above program- first step, have created list that contains decimal values. After this, have declared empty list appended values next step, have taken each element from that list passed into int(). Finally, have displayed resultant list that contains numbers without decimal. Conclusion this Tutorial, started with general idea type numbers Python then learned various methods removing decimals from numbers. Next TopicPython Closure prev next
