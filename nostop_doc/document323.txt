next prev Obfuscating Python program following tutorial, will understand obfuscate python program. will Python package known pyarmor Obfuscation. might sometimes come across scenario where have deliver code directly client certain reasons. However, will lose control code performing such function. such cases, might encrypt script protect retain control, include fallback conditions controlling dependency, just like delivered code only certain amount time. following tutorial, will using function consisting above capabilities address above problems. will using pyarmor python library Obfuscation Python code. let"s started. Creating basic function will start creating Python program file order implement Obfuscation Python code. Within file, will define inference function encrypt later. consider following snippet code inference function. File: func.py importing required modules import import json import from datetime import datetime defining inference function infer(person_name True): present year 2021, then inference function will execute properly, else fails. Here attribute variable contains string version date MM-DD-YYYY format print("Hello person_name inference function been initiated successfully") str(datetime.now().strftime('%m-%d-%Y')) resp "Your license been expired, please contact us." expiration_year int(2023) try: assert int(atr.split('-')[-1]) expiration_year, resp except AssertionError print(resp) sys.exit() above assertion True, will reach until this point, otherwise will stop previous line. tag: print("Inference function been done properly!") return True else: return False __name__ "__main__": infer(person_name "Peter Parker") Function outputs, Case expiration_year int(2021) Hello Peter Parker, inference function been intiated successfully Inference function been done properly! [Finished 0.2s] Case expiration_year int(2022) Hello Peter Parker, inference function been intiated successfully Inference function been done properly! [Finished 0.2s] Case expiration_year int(2023) Hello Peter Parker, inference function been intiated successfully license been expired, please contact [Finished 0.2s] Output: Hello Peter Parker, inference function been initiated successfully Your license been expired, please contact Explanation: above snippet code, have imported some required modules. then defined inference function infer(), which accepts parameters person_name True. have then printed statement user initiating inference function. Later, defined variable that stores current date string variable resp. have also assigned another variable expiration_year 2023. have then used try-exception method order handle exception raised. last, have used if-else conditional statements print statement situation. last, have assigned __name__ "__main__" execute inference function. Now, save this python file folder. Encrypting file using pyarmor process encrypting file with help pyarmor divided into steps: Step Installing pyarmor package install pyarmor package using installer shown below: Syntax: install pyarmor Step Encrypting python file encrypt file typing following command command prompt. Syntax: pyarmor obfuscate --restrict=0 <filename> Now, implement above command func.py file. Syntax: pyarmor obfuscate --restrict=0 func.py Now, open folder consisting original func.py file, will observe subfolder created known dist. Within dist folder, will find another folder pytransform encrypted func.py file. Now, contents inside this file. File: func.py (encrypted) from pytransform import pyarmor_runtime pyarmor_runtime() __pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x50\x59\x41\x52\x4d\x4f\x52\x00\...', Importing Inference function Once done, until this section, importing this encrypted func.py python file known new.py, which created within dist folder. mandatory keys that allow decrypt func.py run-time taken care using pyarmor. presence exists pytransform folder; hence, creating code unreadable other's eyes. However, would like some modifications actual func.py script, have start from step continue following same steps. consider following snippet code that have type within new.py file. File: new.py importing inference function definition inside func.py file from func import infer infer(person_name "Tony Stark") Output: Hello Tony Stark, inference function been initiated successfully Your license been expired, please contact Explanation: above snippet code, have imported inference function func.py python file that created new.py. have then executed that function with same configuration func.py.
