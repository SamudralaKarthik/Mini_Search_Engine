(iii) Listening Sending Events: functions keyboard module Python program listen events that performed keyboard device. Apart from this, also this module send information regarding events performed keyboard which working. also perform both these actions simultaneously using functions keyboard module Python program. (iv) Support complex Hotkeys: keyboard module carry hotkeys tasks keyboard. This module provides functions that support many complex hotkeys tasks, perform these tasks using this module's functions example programs. Apart from above-given actions, following functions also performed using functions keyboard module. keyboard module will continue perform these actions until specified entered stop task. Block keys: keyboard module functions block activity particular from device's keyboard. (vi) Enter keys: functions keyboard module used enter keys from keyboard input command system. (vii) Record keyboard activities: keyboard module functions record activities performed device's keyboard. carry these tasks using functions keyboard module Python programs, will perform some these functions this module implementation part this tutorial. will learn implementation many these functions using keyboard module example programs this tutorial later sections. Keyboard Module Python: Installation keyboard module Python in-built module package Python which means that when install Python system, this package doesn't installed along with Therefore, want work with functions this module learn more about first, have install this module system this module already installed system). install keyboard module Python, multiple methods ways, this installation part, will only installation method install this module. will installer method from command prompt shell install keyboard module because this easiest simplest installation method this module. install keyboard module system using installer method, first, have open command prompt shell system write following command install keyboard When done writing installation command, have press 'enter' key, will give command system start installation process keyboard module. Once installation process this module starts, have wait while take some time install this module system successfully. see, keyboard module successfully installed system, even verify this checking version this module through command prompt shell. Now, move forward implementation part this module start working with functions this module example programs. Keyboard Module Python: Implementation Here, this part, will understand working keyboard module's functions these functions keyboard module perform particular task from keyboard. That's understand implementation this keyboard module. will understand functioning this module example programs will this part. Look following example programs understand implementation keyboard module functions: Blocking Working with Keys: Here, will learn block work with keys keyboard using functions keyboard module. Before discuss more this, let's have look following example program first: Example Look following Python program where have used keyboard module functions block work with keyboard keys: Importing keyboard module import keyboard Giving writing command from keyboard kb.write("Hey Python Developers, welcomed JavaTpoint\n") Using double command keyboard kb.press_and_release('shift shift shift \n') kb.press_and_release('P, N') Blocking other keys keyboard kb.wait('Ctrl') Output: Python Developers, welcomed JavaTpoint JTP ython see, commands have provided keyboard printed output when functions keyboard module executed with example program. keys keyboard will remain blocked output screen until press 'Ctrl' from keyboard. That's functions this keyboard module work with keyboard block keys keyboard. Explanation: have first imported keyboard module 'kb' program easily functions this module given example program. After that, have used write() function this module write sentence output. This function will give command keyboard system write sentence provided argument inside function. Then, used press_and_release() function this module work with keys keyboard once. First, used shift argument inside this function print given letters capital form. Secondly, directly provided some capital letters inside this function argument print them small-case letter form output. Lastly, have used this module's wait() function block working keys keyboard unless specified wait() function pressed. Keyboard Module Work with Hotkeys: will this keyboard module's add_hotkey() function perform hotkey function using keyboard when example program executed successfully. This keyboard module's add_hotkey() function will Hotkey feature command given keyboard through this module. hotkey function will performed according arguments provide inside module's add_hotkey() function.
