next prev Relational Operators Python this tutorial, will discuss different relational operators used Python programs. relational operators also known comparison operators, their main function return either true false based value operands. Following relational operators- Let's start with first one- Greater less than (>, <) program given below illustrates done- Initializing value Calculating print ("The Using relational operators print print print print Output: True False False True Explanation- It's time have look explanation above program- first step, have initialized values variables next step, have calculated Finally, printed values evaluated based greater than less than. greater than gives output 'True', else gives 'False' vice versa. executing given program, desired output displayed. Equals (==) equals '==' operator return True value values stored variables same. following program illustrates usage Initializing value #calculating print ("The print ("The difference Using relational operators print print print print Output: difference True False True True Explanation- Let's understand what happened above program- first step, have initialized values variables next step, have calculated difference Finally, printed values evaluated based greater than, less than, equals equal gives output 'True', else gives 'False' vice versa. executing given program, desired output displayed. Equal (!=) equals '!=' operator returns True value values stored variables different. Consider program given below- Initializing value Calculating print("The print("The difference Using relational operators print(a print(a print(c!=d) print(e==a) Output: difference True True False True Explanation- Let's have glance explanation above program- first step, have initialized values variables next step, have calculated difference Finally, printed values evaluated based greater than, less than, equals equals equal gives output 'True', else gives 'False' vice versa. executing given program, desired output displayed. Finally, will discuss last relational operator which greater than equal less than equal Greater than less than equal (>=, <=) greater than equal returns 'True' value variables greater than equal second one. 'lesser than equal works similar way. used Python program, Initializing value Calculating print("The print("The difference Using relational operators print(a print(a print(c print(e Output: difference True True True True Explanation- program given below illustrates done- first step, have initialized values variables next step, have calculated difference Finally, printed values evaluated based greater than, less than, equals equals greater than equal less than equal greater than equal gives output 'True', else gives 'False' vice versa. executing given program, desired output displayed.
