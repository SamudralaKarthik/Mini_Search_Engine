next prev Python List Comprehension Python known helping produce code that elegant, simple write, reads almost well plain English. List comprehension language's most distinguishing features, allowing develop sophisticated functionality with just line code. other hand, many Python writers struggle fully utilize more complex aspects list comprehension. Sometimes programmers overuse them, resulting much less efficient difficult-to-read code. Using List Comprehension newlist [expression item iterable condition True] Here showing basic list comprehension. Code #using loop iterate through items list numbers numbers: num.append(n**2) print(num) Output: this accomplished with only single line code using list comprehension. Code #using list comprehension iterate through list items numbers [n**2 numbers] print(num) Output: Benefits Using List Comprehensions Loops maps typically regarded more Pythonic than list comprehensions. But, rather than taking that judgment face value, it's worth considering advantages utilizing list comprehension Python over alternatives. We'll learn about couple cases when alternatives preferable options later most important advantages utilizing list comprehension Python that single tool that used various circumstances. don't need adopt strategy each situation. List comprehensions leveraged mapping filtering basic list generation. List comprehensions regarded Pythonic, Python emphasizes simple, effective tools that used many scenarios. bonus, won't have remember appropriate order parameters when using list comprehension Python, would when calling map(). List comprehensions easier read grasp than loops since they more declarative. must concentrate exactly list constructed while using loops. must manually build empty list, then loop over list's entries, each list's end. Instead, using list comprehension Python, concentrate what want list allow Python handle list generation. Code Import module keep track time import time defining function execute loop for_loop(num): range(num): l.append(i return defining function execute list comprehension list_comprehension(num): return range(num)] Giving values functions Calculating time taken loop start time.time() for_loop(10000000) time.time() print('Time taken loop:', (end start)) Calculating time taken list comprehension start time.time() list_comprehension(10000000) time.time() print('Time taken list comprehension:', (end start)) Output: Time taken loop: 7.005999803543091 Time taken list comprehension: 2.822999954223633 Using List Comprehension Iterate through String List comprehension used case strings also they iterables too. Code letters alpha alpha 'javatpoint' print( letters) Output: ['j', 'a', 'v', 'a', 't', 'p', 'o', 'i', 'n', 't'] Using Conditions List Comprehension Conditional statements used list comprehensions change existing lists other tuples). We'll make list with mathematical operators, numbers, range values. Code number_list range(30) print(number_list) Output: Nested List Comprehensions Nested List Comprehensions similar nested loops that they list comprehension inside another list comprehension. programme that implements nested loop follows: Code nested_list range(3): Append empty sublist inside list nested_list.append([]) range(5): nested_list[_].append(__ print(nested_list) Output: [[0, same result created less lines code utilizing layered list comprehensions. Code Nested list comprehension nested_list range(5)] range(3)] print(nested_list) Output: [[0, List comprehension powerful tool describing creating lists based existing ones. general, list comprehension lighter easier than traditional list construction functions loops. provide user-friendly code, should avoid writing large codes list comprehensions. Every interpretation list other iterables recast loop, loops rebuilt framework list comprehension. Next TopicConvert Roman Number Decimal (Integer) Write Python Program Convert Roman Integer prev next
