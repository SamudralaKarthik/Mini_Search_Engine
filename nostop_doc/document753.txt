next prev Mirror Character String Python this tutorial, will learn about mirror characters Python. Mirror characters problem asked technical interview. First, understand mirror characters string. strings same alphabetical position, from front other from back. example mirror character mirror character Let's write Python program find mirror character strings. Find Mirror Characters Python alphanumeric character, have mirror characters from Nth position length string. Let's understand problem statement. Example Input paradox Output paizwlc mirror characters from position end. Input pneumonia Output pnefnlmrz Following different characters their mirror characters. Mirroring refers alphabetical order corresponds corresponds first character becomes last character; second character becomes second last character, write program, will create string character array) which contains English alphabet lower case. take pivot point length reverse alphabetical order character using ASCII value index. Let's understand following example. Example mirror_compute(st, Creating string having reversed alphabetical order reverse_string "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba" len(st) result range(0, result result st[i]; range(n, result (result reverse_string[ord(st[i]) ord('a')]); return result; "javaTpoint" answer mirror_compute(st, print(answer) Output: javzmklrmg Explanation above code, created function mirror_compute() that takes arguments string length. Then created string that reversed alphabetical order. initialized result empty string that stores result given string. given string remains unchanged point specified, from point length string, reverse alphabetical order. Time Complexity Time complexity O(n), where represents size given string. Auxiliary Space: O(1), extra space required, constant. Method this method, will dict() zip() method create dictionary where characters alphabetical order character reverse order will value. Let's understand following example. Example mirror_compute(st, create dictionary order 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' reverse 'zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba' dictChars dict(zip(order,reverse)) divide string string[0:k-1] suffix string[k-1:] mirror change suffix into mirror char range( len(suffix)): mirror mirror dictChars[suffix[i]] join prefix mirrored part return pre+mirror "javaTpoint" answer mirror_compute(st, print(answer) Output: javzmklrmg Conclusion This tutorial introduced mirror characters given string mirror character present possible have written python program find mirror characters.
