next prev Pathlib module Python Interacting with file system working with files crucial various reasons. simplest situations merely entail reading writing files, more sophisticated actions occasionally required. Perhaps need show files directory specific kind, locate file's parent directory, generate file name that doesn't exist. It's impossible develop Python script that doesn't file system somehow. might easy reading data file into pandas DataFrame difficult processing hundreds files highly nested directory structure. these purposes, Python's standard library includes numerous useful methods, notably pathlib module. pathlib module initially appeared Python 3.4, since been improved each succeeding version. Pathlib object-oriented filesystem interface that provides more natural, platform-agnostic, pythonic interact with filesystem. recently completed short project which opted sort handle thousands files nested directory structure using pathlib pandas. That project inspired this article. Once came together, blown away pathlib's capabilities, I'll using future projects without hesitation. versions Python contain pathlib library. obtain newest upgrades, recommend using most recent version Python. I'll using Python this post. advantages pathlib module that easier create routes without using os.joindir. When start tiny projects, example, os.getcwd() create directories subdirectories beneath current working directory. keep working input output files those locations. This that code might look: Syntax: import in_dir os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "in") out_dir os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "out") in_file os.path.join(in_dir, "input.xlsx") out_file os.path.join(out_dir, "output.xlsx") Traditionally, Python used ordinary text strings represent file paths. This proved adequate, little laborious, with help from os.path standard library second example introduction shows). However, because paths strings, functionality dispersed across standard library, including libraries such os, glob, shutil. move text files archive directory, following example requires three import statements: Syntax: import glob import import shutil file_name glob.glob('*.txt'): new_path os.path.join('archive', file_name) shutil.move(file_name, new_path) conceivable, usually, terrible idea, utilise standard string methods with pathways represented strings. Instead joining paths with would with conventional strings, should os.path.join(), which joins paths using operating system's correct path separator. Remember that Windows, separator whereas, Linux, This distinction result difficult-to-detect problems like first example introduction, which only works Windows paths. address these issues, pathlib module added Python (PEP 428). collects required functionality place makes accessible methods properties simple Path object. Other packages used strings file paths first, since Python 3.6, pathlib module been supported throughout standard library, thanks part creating file system path protocol. backport Python also available stuck with legacy Python.
