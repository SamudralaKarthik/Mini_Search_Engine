next prev Python Comments We'll study write comments program this article. We'll also learn about single-line comments, multi-line comments, documentation strings, other Python comments. Introduction Python Comments wish describe code develop. might wish take notes section script functions, instance. leverage remarks accomplish this. Formulas, procedures, sophisticated business logic typically explained with comments. Python interpreter overlooks remarks solely interprets script when running program. Single-line comments, multi-line comments, documentation strings types comments Python. Advantages Using Comments code more comprehensible when comments assists recalling specific sections code were created making program more understandable. Aside from that, leverage comments overlook specific code while evaluating other code sections. This simple technique stops some lines from running creates fast pseudo-code program. Below some most common uses comments: Readability Code Restrict code execution Provide overview program project metadata resources code Types Comments Python Python, there types comments. They described below: Single-Line Comments Single-line remarks Python have shown effective providing quick descriptions parameters, function definitions, expressions. single-line comment Python that hashtag beginning continues until finish line. comment continues next line, hashtag subsequent line resume conversation. Consider accompanying code snippet, which shows single line comment: Code This code show example single-line comment print( 'This statement does have hashtag before it' Output: This statement does have hashtag before following comment: This code show example single-line comment Python compiler ignores this line. Everything following omitted. result, program mentioned above line follows: Code print( 'This comment' this code show example single-line comment Output: This comment This program's output will identical example above. computer overlooks content following Multi-Line Comments Python does provide facility multi-line comments. However, there indeed many ways create multi-line comments. With Multiple Hashtags Python, hashtags multiple times construct multiple lines comments. Every line with before will regarded single-line comment. Code comment extending multiple lines this case, each line considered comment, they omitted. Using String Literals Because Python overlooks string expressions that aren't allocated variable, utilize them comments. Code comment extending multiple lines' observe that running this code, there will output; thus, utilize strings inside triple quotes(""") multi-line comments. Python Docstring strings enclosed triple quotes that come immediately after defined function called Python docstring. It's designed link documentation developed Python modules, methods, classes, functions together. It's placed just beneath function, module, class explain what they perform. docstring then readily accessible Python using __doc__ attribute. Code Code show docstrings Python add(x, """This function adds values y""" return Displaying docstring function print( add.__doc__ Output: This function adds values Next TopicPython Else prev next
