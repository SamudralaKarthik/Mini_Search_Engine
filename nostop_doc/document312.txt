next prev Tuple String Python know that lists, tuples, dictionaries data structures available Python that enable build long codes precise manner. Let's have quick recap tuples. Tuples type data structure Python which immutable elements tuple enclosed within parentheses. Example tup1 (2.3, 4.6, 9.7) tup3 ('C', 'C++', 'JAVA', 'Python', 'R') this article, will discuss methods converting tuple string Python- Using loop Using join Using reduce have look each them- Method Using loop first method, will loop convert Python tuple string. this program, loop will help take each iterator from tuple apply function following program shows done. Example convert_tuple(c_tuple): str='' c_tuple: str=str+i return c_tuple=('P','y','t','h','o','n','a','t','J','T','P') c_string=convert_tuple(c_tuple) print(c_string) Output: PythonatJTP understand what happened above program- have created function that will convert element from tuple string. definition program, have mentioned that each iterator will take element merge with declared empty string. This function will finally return resultant string. Outside function, have declared tuple with name 'c_tuple' then passed into function. executing this program, expected output displayed. Method Using join() method next program, shall join() method help same- join() method takes items combines them form string. following program shows done- Example convert_tuple(c_tuple): str=''.join(c_tuple) return c_tuple=('P','y','t','h','o','n','a','t','J','T','P') c_string=convert_tuple(c_tuple) print(c_string) Output: PythonatJTP understand what happened above program- have created function that will convert element from tuple string. definition program, have mentioned that join() method will take elements from c_tuple merge them with empty string. This function will finally return resultant string. Outside function, have declared tuple with name 'c_tuple' then passed into function. executing this program, expected output displayed. Method Using reduce() Here will make reduce conversion.The following program illustrates done Python- Example import functools import operator convert_tuple(c_tuple): res_str functools.reduce(operator.add, (c_tuple)) return res_str c_tuple ('P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n', 'a', 't', 'J', 'T', 'P') c_string convertTuple(c_tuple) print(c_string) Output: PythonatJTP Explanation first step here import functools operators. After this, have created function that will convert element from tuple string. definition program, have specified parameters operator.add (this will each element from tuple string) inside functools.reduce method. +This function will finally return resultant string. Outside function, have declared tuple with name 'c_tuple' then passed into function. executing this program, expected output displayed. this tutorial, learned various ways converting tuple string Python.
