next prev Python Operators operator defined symbol which responsible particular operation between operands. Operators pillars program which logic built specific programming language. Python provides variety operators, which described follows. Arithmetic operators Comparison operators Assignment Operators Logical Operators Bitwise Operators Membership Operators Identity Operators Arithmetic Operators Arithmetic operators used perform arithmetic operations between operands. includes (addition), (subtraction), *(multiplication), /(divide), %(reminder), //(floor division), exponent (**) operators. Consider following table detailed explanation arithmetic operators. Operator Description (Addition) used operands. example, a+b (Subtraction) used subtract second operand from first operand. first operand less than second operand, value results negative. example, (divide) returns quotient after dividing first operand second operand. example, a/b (Multiplication) used multiply operand with other. example, (reminder) returns reminder after dividing first operand second operand. example, a%b (Exponent) exponent operator represented calculates first operand power second operand. (Floor division) gives floor value quotient produced dividing operands. Comparison operator Comparison operators used comparing value operands returns Boolean true false accordingly. comparison operators described following table. Operator Description value operands equal, then condition becomes true. value operands equal, then condition becomes true. first operand less than equal second operand, then condition becomes true. first operand greater than equal second operand, then condition becomes true. first operand greater than second operand, then condition becomes true. first operand less than second operand, then condition becomes true. Assignment Operators assignment operators used assign value right expression left operand. assignment operators described following table. Operator Description assigns value right expression left operand. increases value left operand value right operand assigns modified value back left operand. example, will equal therefore, decreases value left operand value right operand assigns modified value back left operand. example, will equal therefore, multiplies value left operand value right operand assigns modified value back then left operand. example, will equal therefore, 200. divides value left operand value right operand assigns reminder back left operand. example, will equal therefore, a**=b will equal a=a**b, example, =2, a**=b will assign 4**2 A//=b will equal a// example, a//=b will assign 4//3 Bitwise Operators bitwise operators perform operation values operands. Consider following example. example, then, binary 0111 binary 0110 hence, 0011 0111 0100 1000 Operator Description (binary and) both bits same place operands then copied result. Otherwise, copied. (binary or) resulting will both bits zero; otherwise, resulting will (binary xor) resulting will both bits different; otherwise, resulting will (negation) calculates negation each operand, i.e., resulting will vice versa. (left shift) left operand value moved left number bits present right operand. (right shift) left operand moved right number bits present right operand. Logical Operators logical operators used primarily expression evaluation make decision. Python supports following logical operators. Operator Description both expression true, then condition will true. expressions, true, true true. expressions true, then condition will true. expressions, true, false true. expression true, then will false vice versa. Membership Operators Python membership operators used check membership value inside Python data structure. value present data structure, then resulting value true otherwise returns false. Operator Description evaluated true first operand found second operand (list, tuple, dictionary). evaluated true first operand found second operand (list, tuple, dictionary). Identity Operators identity operators used decide whether element certain class type. Operator Description evaluated true reference present both sides point same object. evaluated true reference present both sides point same object. Operator Precedence precedence operators essential find since enables know which operator should evaluated first. precedence table operators Python given below. Operator Description exponent operator given priority over others used expression. negation, unary plus, minus. multiplication, divide, modules, reminder, floor division. Binary plus, minus Left shift. right shift Binary and. Binary xor, Comparison operators (less than, less than equal greater than, greater then equal to). <> Equality operators.
