next prev Check Version Python most widely used programming languages Python. Python anything with easily understandable syntax, high efficiency, top-notch open-source libraries. However, have noticed that some individuals favor Python whereas others favor Python difference between versions enormous it's simply about fixes features. It's possible that won't able execute program Python created Python interpreter component that receives code aids execution. Because older versions interpreter cause commands fail, because Python dynamic language with regular updates features, user should update interpreter most recent version. result, should know Python version installed machine. Let's look determine Python version. We'll begin with command prompt. obtain details Python Interpreter, methods listed below: python command Using sys.version method And, python_version() function Using Command Line simply verify Python version command line/terminal/shell. Let's over command line various operating systems. Linux Open terminal window Windows Follow these steps open command line windows. Type Powershell Press Win+R Press Enter macOS Follow these steps open command line macOS. Click Applications Finder Choose Utilities Terminal This approach easiest ways since uses built-in commands Python acquire current Python version. following some steps that user must obtain Python interpreter's most recent version: Launch cmd/terminal/Powershell Windows Write following command command line python Command C:\Users\HP> python Output: Python 3.10.0 Using sys.version Method When coding application, might wish confirm Python version (i.e., using). This especially beneficial machine many Python versions installed. platform modules determine which Python version currently active. Linux, Windows, macOS, script will same. five components version number represented tuple: major, minor, micro, releaselevel, serial. values integers except releaselevel, which might 'alpha', 'beta', 'candidate', 'final'. 'final', version_info value relating Python version 2.0. sys.version_info[0] similar sys.version_info.major, Code import print("Version") print(sys.version) print("Version info.") print(sys.version_info) Output: Version 3.10.2 (main, 2022, 20:52:01) [Clang 14.0.0 (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project 78e87970af888bbbd5652c31f3a8 Version info. sys.version_info(major=3, minor=10, micro=2, releaselevel='final', serial=0) Using python_version() Function Importing library platform will give user access this method, which always returns string containing current user's Python version. Code from platform import python_version print("Active Version Python Interpreter", python_version()) Output: Active Version Python Interpreter 3.10.2 Next TopicPython List Comprehension prev next
