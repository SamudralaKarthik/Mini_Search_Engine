next prev Dynamic Typing Python this tutorial, will understand what's dynamic typing python. Whenever write program python, come across different statements, them assignment statement where initialize variable with value. assignment different case Python. When talk about languages like C++, Java memory allocated based data type variable accessed accordingly whereas python being dynamically typed language stores value some location then combines respective variable name with container. data type determined time. Consider program given below- 12.0 print(type(a)) print(type(b)) 'data' print(type(c)) print print print Output: <class 'float'> <class 'int'> <class 'str'> 36.0 datadatadata Explanation: Let's have look explanation this program- first step, have initialized variables with different types. After this, have checked their type that comes float, integer, string respectively. next step, three them multiplied three. Since data type known time, operations performed based type. observe that first value output float value, next value integer, string multiplied three times. executing program, expected output displayed. Relationship Between Objects, Variables References. following sequence steps happens when assign variable Python- create object memory that contains value. variable name doesn't exist already, create reference assigned object variable. Consider program given below- 12.0 print (type(a)) print(type(a)) 'data' print (type(a)) 2+3j print (type(a)) Output: <class 'float'> <class 'int'> <class 'str'> <class 'complex'> Explanation: Let's understand what happened above program. have initialized variable with values different data types. After this, have checked type each case. From this, infer that- first case, reference float object. second case, reference integer object. third case, reference string object. fourth case, reference complex object. Shared References Before starting with this, let's have look program- 12.0 print(a) print(b) Output: 12.0 12.0 Explanation: It's time understand what exactly happened here- have initialized value 12.0 After this, have printed values both that comes 12.0 This nothing concept shared references which says that "Two variables have same reference." more example would make clearer. 12.0 print(a) print(b) Output: 84.0 12.0 Explanation: Let's have look explanation this program- have initialized value 12.0, then again assigned with After this, have printed values both that come 84.0 12.0 case because still referencing first value Disadvantage Dynamically Typed Languages feature that makes language like Java more convenient that statically typed bugs errors reported compile-time instead run-time. Therefore, it's major concern python developers that errors shown during run-time therefore they have develop strategies rectify them. Conclusion Culminating tutorial, that python dynamically typed language here understood what distinct characteristics that observed while working Next TopicFabs Python prev next
